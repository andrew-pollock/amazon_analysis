2017-01-09,"the third and final entry in the Thrawn saga","This is a well-written and entertaining Star Wars story, set a few years after the events seen in Return of the Jedi. The rebels have been victorious, and set about building a New Republic. Meanwhile the defeated Empire has sought to bring together its remaining remnants, under the leadership of Grand Admiral Thrawn - who serves as a central antagonist of this novel.This is the third and final entry in a trilogy of books; it follows on from Star Wars - Volume 1: Heir to the Empire and Star Wars - Volume 2: Dark Force Rising. These were the initial instalments of the Star Wars Extended Universe, as represented canon while George Lucas owned Lucasfilm. Disney have sought to re-write what's known as ""canon"" - nonetheless this book, as with many others of the Extended Universe, is well worth a read. If you're a fan of the original trilogy of films then I recommend it.",4,"UK"
2017-06-19,"An OK third book with a disappointing finish","An overall nice finale to the original Thrawn trilogy, and overall I enjoyed it, however - and it feels like quite a big however - It does end rather abruptly with what feels like little closure.Without being too spoilerific, the final battle starts out well for the Imps, goes a little wrong, then suddenly they are in retreat and it's over.  No middle ground, just a seemingly spontaneous rout.  I re-read the chapter in case I'd missed a page or two, but that was it - quite disappointing after being invested in the story.  Several loose ends are left dangling.  It gave me second thoughts about The Hand of Thrawn two-book series, as Zahn seemed to be bored with it.",3,"UK"
2017-09-28,"Its easy one of the best storys in the expanded universe","All tho its no longer canon thanks to Disney for killing the franchise. Its easy one of the best storys in the expanded universe. It reads perfectly like a movie like a movie. great book must read for any star wars fan. I would recommend reading heir to the empire and dark force rising first. 10/10",5,"UK"
2015-10-07,"Amazing trilogy","Amazing, love Timothy Zahn's Star Wars books. Can't wait to read more.  Was gutted when this trilogy ended, I would have been happy to keep buying and reading.",5,"UK"
2014-08-07,"Zahn strikes again.","A great ending to an amazing story, truly an unexpected ending too. Timothy Zhan is probably the only man you can trust with the Star Wars universe in my opinion. I imagine if he wrote the films, the prequels would've been epic.",5,"UK"

2000-10-26,"Wow...  Does this guy know his stuff or what?","I've got all three versions of this, (paperback/graphic/audio) and aside from listening to Anthony Daniels doing all the other voices on the tape versions, (Absolutely hilarious by the way...) this is one of the best star wars books I've seen so far. I did notice one important mistake though, which was 'how did C'Boath brainwash the clone if he couldn't use the Force?'  but even this can't take away from the rest of the book, which truly shows how much effort and attention to detail Zahn put into this.  All in all an amazing end to a top notch trilogy which gets better with each book.",5,"UK"

2004-11-03,"The war against Thrawn reaches it's surprising conclusion.","Five years after 'Return of the Jedi', Grand Admiral Thrawn desires to draw the New Republic into a decisive battle.  To that end he launches cloaked asteroids into Coruscant's orbit and the New Republic have no choice but to attempt the theft of an Imperial anti-cloak device.  Meanwhile, Han, Luke, Leia, Lando, Chewie and Mara undertake a mission to destroy Thrawn's cloning facility on Wayland.  However, the insane Jedi Joruus C'baoth awaits them avidly.This book has all of the great elements of the previous two, dramatic action, subtle military strategy, political tension and extensive character development.  The climatic Battle of Bilbringi is an unmissable Star Wars moment, recalling elements of the Emperor's 'surprise' in 'Return of the Jedi'.  My favourite part of this book is where the New Republic's heroes defy their government to break Mara out of imprisonment, an act of faith in her that causes some dramatic development of her character.  The confrontation in the Mount Tantiss throne room also brilliantly captures the atmosphere of 'RotJ', but with C'baoth's minion proving to be a welcome surprise (I won't give away details, but it's one of the best handlings of this sort of thing happening to a main character that I've read).Thrawn's end, although entirely fitting, was somewhat abrupt and the otherwise excellent battle scene therefore also ended too abruptly.",5,"UK"
1999-06-05,"A masterpiece really..............nothing else","This book is the last in the trilogy (Heir to the empire, Dark force rising, Last Command). And is really worth of being the last book. Usually  are the last ones in the trilogy the best ones and this one fits it the  most. Couldn't be better.Here are all well known characters from the  part II of this trilogy: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Lando  Calrissian, Jedi Master C'Baoth, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Karrde,  ...... Some of them die in the end (the bad guys only - darn :) ), but none  of the good guys (and girls).This is the part, where the rebels find out  that Grand Admiral Thrawn is using clones and they must stop him or they  will die (rebels doesn't have so many soldiers than the Empire has clones).  That is why they have to go to the dragons nest where the clones are  produced. There they meet Jedi Master C'Baoth who made a clone of Luke  Skywalker (from Luke Skywalker's hand which he left in the Cloud City). And  then Luke fights against his clone. Mara Jade saves Luke and kills the  clone and together they destroy C'Baoth.This book really keeps you  reading and you just can't stop. Once I found myself reading it till 4 am.  I had to go to work at 5 am. This means only one hour sleep, but I didn't  miss it. Not with this good story. Timothy Zahn really did a splended job.",5,"UK"
1999-03-08,"THE GRIPPING CONCLUSION TO THE #1 BEST-SELLING SAGA!","The Empire, now under the command of Grand Admiral Thrawn, is producing cloned enemy fighters from an unknown origin. On Coruscant, the heart of  the Rebellion, Leia Organa Solo is fighting an unseen enemy: Delta Source,  a secret listening system developed by the Empire. Meanwhile, Luke  Skywalker has traveled to the city Calius, in hope of finding the source or  any information leading to the cloning that is threatening the very  survival of the Rebellion. On Corusscant, Leia finds a new source of  informatmion that is very helpful, but her luck does not hold out. The  Empire attacks Coruscant, releasing cloaked man-made asteroids into  Coruscant's atmosphere. Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian, Han Solo,  Chewbacca, Mara Jade, C-3PO, and R2-D2, set out to Wayland, the location of  the cloning fortress, to destroy it. As the story continures, the four  humans, one Wookie, and two droids find dangers at every corner. As the  team continure their search on Wayland, they finally find the cloning  wharehouse. They eneter without any problems, only to find the cloned Jedi  Master C'baoth waiting for them! As the two Jedi, mara and Luke, find  themselves fighting the insane Jedi Master, the rest of the team are trying  to find a way to destroy the fortress before it's too late.",5,"UK"
1998-06-14,"An extremely good book for SW fans or not - action packed","I rarely give out five stars, but this book raelly deserved it. Zahn did an excellent job from begining to end. Loads of action especially during the battle between Skywalker,Mara, and C'baoth.Two of my favorit scenes is when Trrawn sends out his elite forces after Leia and her twins. The other is when Luke and Mara battle the literally insane Jedi Master C'baoth.Lando Calrissian one of the over looked character in the Star Wars books that I've read many has a very impotant part in protecting Leia, as well as the Noghri.I like this part< because it's awesome how Thrawn infiltrates the Rebel base located on Coruscant in the palace of the late emperor Palpatine. I like the battle between Master C'baoth,Luke, and Mara, because it has a lot of action and an interesting plot turn lots of rock falling. There even a Luke vs. Luke battle. The ending is also very uique, some may say it's simple maybe those of you who like big explosions where the enemy could always survive. However Thrawn's end is pretty up close and personal.The only thing I can find possibly bad about this series is that Tommothy Zahn and this series may be slightly over rated but I think it's well desrved.",5,"UK"
1998-07-05,"My first Star Wars book","This was the very first Star Wars book I ever bought.  It first attracted me because it talked about the twins being born.  I bought the book, and even though I didn't know who half the characters were (because being the genius I am, I bought the last book of the trilogy), I was immediately hooked.  Thrawn's personality was bone-chilling, because even though he didn't like to waste the lives of his crew, he could still be incredibly ruthless.  Mara Jade was my favorite character, and she always will be.  I loved her because of the fact that after all she's been through, she still has the courage and the guts to stand up for herself and save the day when Luke starts to get a little wussy.  Plus, she's a smartass woman that can do anything that any of the other men can.  After finishing this book, I went out and bough the others in this series, and after that, I started buying more and more books.  My only complaint--I wish I had found them earlier.",5,"UK"
1996-06-29,"Last Clash Between Grand Admiral Thrawn And The New Republic","After reading the other novles in this trilogy, I waspleased to find many exciting plot twists and daring new adventures in this, the final book in Timothy Zahns Block- buster saga. If you have read the other books you will not be disipointed. Zahns smooth discriptions and great ability to mimic the personalities of the famed Star Wars caracters make this book one of the all time great Science Fiction showdowns. The action is so intense, the drama so tight, that you will swear that you can hear the John Williams score in the background. This book, and the other two in the trilogy, are a great way to sastisfy yours, [ or someone elses ] craving to experiance new adventures in the Star Wars Univers.",5,"UK"
1999-02-22,"This the best Star Wars book ever!","This book is amazing! Timothy Zahn paints vivid pictures of the characters and the different settings in this well-written story. To me, this book  seems to come straight from the mind of George Lucas. The characters are  exactly like the ones we remember from the movies with the same  personalities and all. The different settings in the story are beautifully  described in powerful and vivid writing.  The book is easy enough to  follow and flows along very well. However, I found it difficult to pick out  some of the details that make the story completely clear such as, the  discovery of the mysterious "" Delta Source"" (don't worry I'm not  going to give it away!)  I think this is definitely the best book for a  SW fan!",5,"UK"
1999-07-10,"Best of the three books, and a must-read for Star Wars fans","When I read Heir to the Empire, I couldn't wait for the next book to come out. When I read Dark Force Rising, I didn't think it could get any better.  But when I read The Last Command, I knew that it had.  The Last Command is  definately the best of the three books in this trilogy. Everything was  perfect. The best section of the book must have been the battle between  Luke, Mara, and C-boath. I had personally been waiting for that battle to  unfold through the other two books. It was one thing to have C'boath and  Luke fight, but Zahn doesn't stop there. A clone of Luke was one of the  best ideas I've ever seen. The clone definately should not have died,  though. It would have been legendary to have two Lukes, one on the Light  side of the Force, one on the Dark side. Anyway, the inner battles between  Luke and Mara were resolved wonderfully. I think one of the best parts is  reading about Mara's hatred of him slowly vanish.",5,"UK"
1998-08-11,"a horrible book","even though it's the best of Zhan's triology , that's not saying much. Everything in the trilogy ties together in a way that it's unbelivable. Luke  , Leia , Han , Lando , Thrawn and the rest of the gang are always at the right place at the right time. Think about Nkllon , Sluis Van , Honoghr , New Cov (where HAn and Lando found The key to Feyla's plan , ON THE FIRST PLANET THEY VISIT!!) Thrawn is a cool idea that was ruined by Zahn. All he did was bully a few Noghris and smugglers. People say he almost brought down the Republic , where and when did he do that ? He attacked a few shipyards and a few planets , out of millions and millions. I was left with a  tottaly unsatisfied feeling and wondering what's wrong with all the people that like this trilogy. Mara Jade is the typical obnoxious beat up -anyone-in-her-way female that are all over the place now. Karrde is a Thrawn wannabe. and the names Zahn uses are really corny (ie ""Emperor's Hand"" , ""Dark Forc! e""  , etc..) , in short a very bad trilogy that got so famous because it was the first Star Wars novel in the 90's . Read Wolverton's Courtship of Princess Leia and see the kind of style i like.",2,"UK"
1998-06-06,"What can I say?","This is one of the best books I have read in my entire life. I read it for the first time in '95 and have reread it time and again. The characterization, plot, action........ hell, everything about this book made it great. Zahn is truly a master of his art, an auhtor without peer. I wish I'd had the chance to read it much earlier, unfortunately I wasn't able to but when I finally did I was basically speechless. Zahn has a style that really gets the reader into the book, so much so that you don't want to put it down. I'm an aspiring writer, and all I can say is that I would love to be compared to him (even if I recieve a bad review).",5,"UK"
1998-02-06,"Please, DO write some more STAR WARS books for us, Mr. Zahn!","This trilogy definitely is by far the absolute best stuff I've ever read in my life!Not one of the other STAR WARS authors did manage to write a story so thrilling and true to the characters of the original as Mr. Zahn did. Perhaps even more so. I must admit that he's a genius. And I'm not a person to say so very often.Till now I've read about seventeen English STAR WARS books, but after reading this trilogy (I'm reading the books in chronological order), I didn't really believe that someday I would happen to find a better book lying in my hands.Actually, I never did.May the force be with you, DANA (Germany)",5,"UK"
1997-03-19,"The best book I have ever read!!!","If you only read one book in your life, this should be it.  Zahn's characterization of Luke, Han, Leia, etc. is great.  The book is action packed from cover to cover, and concludes his Star Wars book trilogy in epic fashion.  Zahn provides the New Republic (formerly the Rebellion) with a stern challenge in the form of Grand Admiral Thrawn, a military genius, and Joruus C'baoth, an insane Jedi Master.  There are several interesting sub-plots in this book and in Zahn's trilogy, these contribute greatly to the overall plot of the story.  I didn't think a book, could match the magic of the Star Wars movies, I was wrong.",5,"UK"
1997-08-14,"The author of this book knew what he was doing.","So many times you'll find a book about a certain series and it just doesn't fit with what everyone else wrote.Not this one. It fits perfectly with everything that had been writen before it.He explains everything very well and puts it all together with great style. He spends enough time with each of the characters so you know what's going on but not to much so you know exactly what's going to happen.The climax at the end of it was truly worth the Star Wars name. Well done Mr. Zahn!! My favorite part of the book was the last chapter although I think he should have gone a little farther.",5,"UK"
1999-07-13,"An awsome book","I have always been a fan of starwars.  I loved the other two books in the series (heir to the empire, dark force rising), but when I read the final  conclusion, I thought that it was the best book that I had ever read. There  were many new characters, like Grand Admiral Thrawn, Captain Pellaon, Talon  Karrade, Joruus C'baoth and Mara Jade, that were fascinating. I felt like I  was there in that last battle against C'baoth.  It was very fitting when  Mara killed Luuke and C'baoth.  What a great way to end the story.  It is  a book that I recomend every star wars fan should read.",5,"UK"
1997-11-22,"A great book which really captures the feel of Star Wars","I can't say anything about hearing a John Williams score in the background, but I can say that it is, in all probability, better than the original trilogy that started it all (no offence meant, George). It's atmosphere is very imaginable the way it is presented, and still somehow leaves enough out the first few times, that you can pick it up in subsequent readings. The first two books in the trilogy can fill in some details, also, to give you a more complete picture. Zahn's projection of technology also gives you things to think about, even when you have long since finished.",5,"UK"
1999-02-12,"Best book I have ever read....! Excellent work...!","I will make this short and sweet.Get this book and all of Mr. Timothy Zahns Star Wars novels. If you call yourself a true SW person, you must  read these books. You will be so glad you did.A reader from Honolulu,  Hawaii , February 10,  where it was Luke vs Luuke, and the only problem  was, how did Joruus get the Force bacK from the ysalamari!Joruus had  his private Stormtroopers plant bombs on them and had them killed when he  pressed the trigger. (Reread that part in the book).Well done Mr. Zahn,  don't ever Stop writting SW novels...!!!!",5,"UK"
1998-07-07,"THE BEST!!!","I read this about two years ago, and I admit, I don't remember all of it.  But I can tell you that it was AWESOME!  Timothy Zahn is a master at portraying lively characters - you get to know each character very personally, which you rarely find in books.  Yeah, true, Thrawn was probably the favorite for most people who have read the book, but you can't deny that Mara was the bomb!  I have been immensely disappointed after reading many of the other Star Wars books afterwards (Jedi Academy seemed like a children's book compared to this), so Zahn - please write more!",5,"UK"
1999-12-16,"Mr Perfect-Cheese says ""Mr Zahn - Best Star Wars writer""","Having read all three in this trilogy, obviously, Timothy Zahn really seems to develop the existing characters and introduces very strong new ones, totally in-keeping with the spirit of Star Wars.  The books make  entertaining reading and would make superb films. Only thing that does bug  me though is that Grand Admiral Thrawn, a believable character though he  is, seems to know too much about everything that is going on in the galaxy.  Mr Zahn does sometimes make a galaxy seem the size of a small village in  Devon because the main 'baddie' seems to know what everyone is doing all of  the time.  Apart from that the books were excellent with a brilliant twist  in this last book.",5,"UK"
1997-12-03,"The Trilogy's end;nothing short of what came to be expected!","When I started to reaaad this, I was already over-whelmed by the first two novels in the series. Timothy Zahn provided me with one of the best novels in terms of thrills, anticipationa nd action, that I have yet read. For every fan of the Star Wars saga, this trilogy is a must read.Luke and Liea battle for the Jedi children and the continuation of the Jedi Knights. The Imperial Admiral does everything in his power to destri them. Gut-wrenching traps, Slicing escapes and Explosive battles come together in this last of the trilogy series.",5,"UK"
1998-04-17,"An excellent work","This was an excellent book, in turn part of an excellent trilogy. As with many others I was saddened to see the brilliant military genius of Grand Admiral Thrawn die in the end but I thought that Zahn made his death as graceful as his life. The other character I have to compliment Zahn on is Captain Pellaeon who captures the essence of an Imperial officer perfectly, to the point where even the greatest supporters of the rebels can sympathise with him.  An excellent book that gives even greater depth to the Star Wars universe.....",5,"UK"
1998-12-29,"Absolutly fantastic. Can't put it down.  Zahn Rules","Awesome. Terrific.  Fun packed to the end.  Our old friends come back for another adventure that rivals the original trilogy.  Thrawn is a great  villain.  Karrde is a great new character that could be a powerful ally or  a fearsome enemy.  Keeps you guessing wich he's gonna turn out to be during  all 3 books.  I loved every word of these books.  Every SW fan must read  it.  Jade is a great counterpart for Luke, Karrde for Han.  Each finds in  the other something of himself and a little bit more.  Excellent.",5,"UK"
1998-12-09,"Excellent characterization and beautiful plotting","The Thrawn trilogy were the first SW novels I read and so far, the best.  Zahn not only managed to breathe new life into all the characters from the  movies, he gave them a plausible villian and a plausible threat.  Thrawn is  easily the best-worked villian in the entire SW universe, and the only one  who truly manages to portray the Empire as something other than evil.  In  his actions, he shows the desire for order, which is a historically  plausible reason for imperialism.  A beautiful book.",5,"UK"
1999-07-11,"Good, but lacking in some areas","A decent conclusion to the Zahn trilogy.  A few problems with it though: I found the fact that Fey'lya was still on the new republic counsel after  what he did in the last book ridiculous.  Also, the ending battles, both in  space and in the throne room had some flaws.  The smugglers part in the  space battle made little sense.  As well, Mara destroying both of the  enemies in the throne room was also disappointing.  Overall, the trilogy  was decent reading, but it did not feel like star wars.",3,"UK"
2002-06-08,"Brill","Although Im a great fan of Star Wars, I never really cared for the 'Expanded Universe Books', I thought that they couldnt give me more joy and excitemnet as the films did, I was wrong! After reading Zahn's, 'Heir to the Empire' and 'Dark Force Rising', I was utterly enthralled by them, I had to buy the third enstallment, 'The Last Command', whhich in my opinion, is the best of the Trilogy. The way that Zahn describes every tiny detail to get the image across is excellent, I never thought that there could be another villian to fill the shoes of Vader and the Emperor, but Zahn delivered us Grand Admiral Thrawn, everything you'd expect of a Warlord. The book is written beautifully, the scenes between Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker are superbly written, although they are not together in this series, you can see their relationship develloping. The insane Jedi, Joruus C'boath is excellently potrayed in this book, even the words he says give a sense and feeling of madness!. I would recommend this book to anyone.",5,"UK"
1998-06-23,"A typical happy-ending  farytail in the classic SW universe.","When you've read this book you think -  Oh Thats It !? The Last Command features the same story as the other SW books/movies: A large and ruthless Empire that wants to eliminate all enemies. But then as always the good guys win and every body's happy - except the reader !  This is just so trivia.  You never se the situations from the Empires point of view. How does the avereage private man feel about this. You only read about the good old rebellion witch dosent stand a chance, but wins anyway !!!  Don't spend your money on this if you're not a SW freak",2,"UK"
1999-10-16,"And finally...","You've finished re-establishing yourself in Lucas' universe in 'Heir to the Empire', you've completed your Bothan studies in 'Dark Force Rising',  and now, you're about to place the icing on the cake in Zahn's thrilling  climax - 'The last Command'. Well don't hesitate. The tables have turned  once again, and spinning that table is the hand of Thrawn. The Empire has  risen to power once again, and what seemed like an unsavoury clean-up  process for the Rebellion has once again erupted into full scale war.  Zahn's third installment is a wonderfull read, as characters genuinley come  of age, they develop before the mids eye, maturing, learning, and often  compromising, and this is exactly what makes 'The last Command' the finale  it needed to be. I'm sure you don't need to be persuaded any more, but  here's a thought. A Grand Admiral with the sheer genius of Thrawn... an  almost poetic knack of out-smarting opponents, a character with some of the  most fantastically strategic and ingenious tactics that ever graced a  novel... then think how clever you must have to be to orchestrate the every  though of a character like that. Well done Timothy Zahn... may the force be  with you.",5,"UK"
1998-11-02,"One of the best!","This has got to be one of the best Star Wars books ever written, and it is in the best series as well. Timothy Zahn has given us a superb book with an  involving storyline, interesting new characters, new species, new planets,  and they all come together in this amazing end to the trilogy. Zahn manages  to portray the characters much more accurately than many of the other Star  Wars authors around. This book is a must buy if you liked the first two in  the series.",5,"UK"
1999-07-16,"Zahn does it again!!! The best of the Thrawn trilogy!!!","What can I say? This is THE BOOK!!!! Everything from the Noghri, to the final confrontation between Luke, Mara, and C'Boath is absolutely breath  taking. The idea about the clone was perfect, and introducing Karde into  the Star Wars novels was a great beginning. Nobody can match wits with  Zahn, and he is still undisputed master of the Star Wars galaxy. If you  have anything to do with Star Wars, you must read this book, and the force  is definitly with Zahn.",5,"UK"
1998-04-07,"This book has great action.","The Last Command has great scennes with Mara Jade, Galatic Master of Sarcasam. Who else would have the nerve to say things like that to Joruus C'Boath? Our honorable little Jedi Knight tries the begging and pleading technique that never gets him anywhere, but does he learn? No. What a surprise.It is much more gripping than Heir to the Empire or Dark Force Rising, but has less parts of Luke and Mara acting like third graders.",5,"UK"
1997-06-26,"A true masterpiece, a tragedy worthy of Shakespeare.","Timothy Zahn brings the readers almost to tears as the great Grand Admiral quotes: ""But, it was so artistically done.""  Those loyal Imperials out there are truly saddened, as if it actually happened, as if Star Wars was real.  That's what Zahn does: he brings the mythos to life.  I salute Zahn, and I salute the greatest character ever created in Star Wars, save the Emperor, Thrawn: May you rest in peace, sir.",5,"UK"
1999-02-18,"Required Reading for any Star Wars Fan","Zahn is a master at how he weaves wonderful new experiences into the lives of the characters that we know and love.  The trilogy that this book is  part of is a sci-fi masterpiece and serves as a great example of how Star  Wars novels should be written! Bravo!  Mara Jade was a brilliant idea and  she is not a run of the mill character, but rather a complicated enigma  that is sure to live on in many novels to come!",5,"UK"
2000-11-02,"A Triumph for The Star Wars, Ongoing, Saga","I originally bought the first book, of this three part series, at a jumble sale. I was sceptical of the many additional storylines that have been spawned form the films.Timothy Zahn in my opinion has written a trilogy, that would surpass the films. It was intriguing, and had me totally engrossed. I thoroughly recommend the series of books (as they all have to be read in order to fully understand the whole storyline) for not just Star Wars fans, but any one who enjoys, a well documented Saga!",5,"UK"
1999-07-30,"Almost Perfect.  Almost...","I loved this book except for one thing: the big finale between Luke and the bad Jedi.  I guess a fight is a fight is a fight, and even a good  writer can't do much new with one.  Still, great characters, wonderful  scheming and counter-scheming, and a sense of wonder that are sorely  missing from the new film.  And the way Thrawn gets his come-upance was  brilliant.  Bring on the new books!",4,"UK"
1998-04-07,"THIS WAS A FANTASTIC BOOK!!","This was an awesome end to a great series. I was kind of dissappointed to see Thrawn go down, and i would have liked to know what other toys and secrets lay hidden in mount tantiss by the Emperor. Other than that, the book delivered. The final scenes with C'Baoth were great and I was relieved when Mara Jade finally fullfilled her mission...  AN EXCELLENT READ!!",5,"UK"
1998-01-28,"Don't know about the ending, but still a sweet trilogy!","I feel that if you have seen the movies and can't wait for the next Trilogy then you have to revert to reading some books.  Well these are about as close as you are going to get to the original characters and action without actually watching the movies.  Good story, clever settings.  The only complaint would have to be the ending, but it's still ok. - J.A.S.",4,"UK"
1999-08-04,"Simply superb!","I have read the tree books of THRAWN WARS from Timoty Zahn, this books are simply superb, they keep the pure style of STARWARS TRILOGY and currenty  Episode I, it will be a shame if George Lucas won't  take them to the  movies, i have that concern,(perhaps in 10 years, who knows)the writing is  very descriptive,so you can have very fine details. ENJOY THEM!",5,"UK"
1997-05-12,"AMAZING AND GRIPPING!!!","There is No better SW book than this!I have never ever felt so inspired by a book that can actually create a much more interesting and inventive atmosphere using the known characters, machinery, fighters and aliens than I ever believed!!! THIS SHOULD BE A PRIME EXAMPLE TO ANYONE WISHING TO WRITE A SEQUEL TO ANY BOOK!",5,"UK"
1998-11-29,"Simply the Best","I had only seen the Star Wars movies once when I read this book in seventh grade.  I got hooked.  This was one of the best books about Star Wars ever  written, second only to Children of the Jedi.  The book took a few  unexpected turns, but it was worth it.  If you like Star Wars, make sure  you read this book.  It's one of the best.",5,"UK"
1999-02-10,"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is the best book I've ever read. Joruus C'boath is the craziest SW character, and Grand Admiral Thrawn WAS ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS ON THE  PLANET! I love this book!  I love the part where it was Luke vs Luuke, and  the only problem was, how did Joruus get the Force bacK from the ysalamari!  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,"UK"
1999-08-08,"GREAT, Of of those 'Stay-Up-Till-3-in-the-morning-reading-it","It's really good. I suggest anyone really interested in Star Wars should read this.

That's just stupid!READ THE BOOK,  IT ROCKS!!!!!",5,"UK"
1999-06-26,"Worthy ending to great trilogy","Tim Zahn has delivered a worthy finale to his famed and undisputed Thrawn Trilogy. Though this book was basically great, Zahn's introduction of so  many new characters (smugglers mostly) and locations got confusing. But, if  you wanna see how a real Star Wars author does it, buy this book and its  two prequels.",4,"UK"
1999-06-01,"Best Star Wars book written to date","This whole trilogy gets five stars. This book in particular is perhaps the best Star Wars book that has been written since the original trilogy.

1997-10-01,"Extensively Overwhelming Conclusion is a Hit","This book is simply a masterpiece, although,  if you read it directly after HEIR, you might notice that HEIR is more likeable in a way that it is more like the movie trilogy. Zahn has  marvelously captured the flavor of STAR WARS,  although a slot weaker than HEIR in some aspects. ZAHN'S TRILOGY RULES!",5,"UK"
1999-03-18,"A gripping conclusion to a great saga","...Simply incredible. The brilliant writing of Mr. Zahn brings forth the feeling of the Star Wars saga. It tells of the ever-growing insanity of  Joruus C'baoth and the fate of Grand Admiral Thrawn. A truly great book,  though a bit depressing because Thrawn died. I got kind of attached to him.",5,"UK"
1999-07-16,"Timothy  Zahn's is a master storyteller.","This book was a great conclusion to the star wars trilogy. I would love to see George Lucas add this trilogy, for episode 7 thru 9.

2000-08-08,"Gripping till the end","I have just finished reading the empire trilogy. In brief, I can only say that I was transported into the midst of the action with a big tub of popcorn on my knee. TZs writing is second to none - all our favourite  characters were there - he captures the ambiance that is Star Wars. Thrawn  was so well described you could see him constantly coming out of the  shadows with some deadly counter action if you dared to even put the book  down for a second (which was practically impossible). As a trilogy, I had  to keep all three books together for fear of loosing the continuity. But  dont just listen to me rambling on about it, go and buy the books ""YOU  WILL BUY THE BOOKS!""",5,"UK"

1999-03-23,"What a GREAT Book","This is the best book I have ever read.  The super climatic end to the perfect series.  I especially love the introduction of Mara Jade into the  star wars world. I also became very attatched to Grand Admiral Thrawn, and  the way he died was a great ending.",5,"UK"
1997-11-04,"Really awesome","This book is the best Star Wars book ever! Because, ""It was so artistically done."" As well,  C'baoth is a ""mindless philosipher"" and truly insane. In short, the book, for heroes and villains, is ""725 to 1""!",5,"UK"
1998-03-23,"If you like Star Wars and you haven't read this,READ IT","The Last Command is a high suspenseful story with lots of Star Wars action.

2018-08-05,"Dated by the prequels, but still better than Disney's films","I re-read this trilogy after becoming disillusioned with the Disney sequel trilogy.  I enjoyed this MUCH more.  I know there was a lot of ""Expanded Universe"" (now Legends) crap being published, but the Thrawn Trilogy was not among it.You could tell it was written prior to the release of the Prequel trilogy because of terms like ""Dark Jedi"" instead of ""Sith"" and other things that don't quite fit with those films.  However, it's very easy to read past those inconsistencies and enjoy this trilogy.  I really wish Disney had re-worked these books into their trilogy so that events herein take place 30 years after Return of the Jedi rather than the 5 years in this book.  It would have been MUCH more enjoyable.",5,"US"
2017-08-25,"Best Star Wars author best series in the fanverse","Timothy Zahn Star Wars books are the best and Thrawn is a great villain. The detail about the force abilities and thinking that goes behind Luke's choices is done very well. I never thought I'd like a Star Wars fan fiction book until I read this series. If you are a fan I highly recommend it as will anyone else who has ever read any Star Wars books. It's obviously good enough that Disney even added Thrawn to the official Star Wars universe as he is in the show 'Star Wars: Rebels.' I'm sure many would agree all the Thrawn books, would have made for great movies, but still they are great on their own no matter what the movies do with the characters",5,"US"
2016-09-26,"The story flows seamlessly from one scene to the next as the action progresses culminating - much like Return of the Jedi - with","The final installment of the Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy has everything anyone reading the first two novels in this series could have wanted.  The story picks up approximately a month after the events of Dark Force Rising as the Empire begins to press the advantage they won at the end of the last novel.  Once again, Zahn's writing shines as he uses such vivid detail that it is almost impossible not to visualize the story as if you were watching it on a screen.  The story flows seamlessly from one scene to the next as the action progresses culminating - much like Return of the Jedi - with a space battle, a ground battle and a force battle at once, ensuring a gripping finale to an outstanding series.",5,"US"
2017-07-20,"A trilogy from a true master of words!","Timothy Zahn is a mastermind of science fiction.  As an author his brilliance is on par with Poul Anderson and the like. This series is an amazing continuation of the Star Wars universe. Especially considering he does so much to build characters, create new worlds and all while staying in line with the amazing alternate universe that is the Star Wars universe.A must read, it will fill in gaps and create new and better possibilities.",5,"US"
2017-12-16,"Star Wars: The Last Novel","This is it; the last Star Wars novel worth reading.  Even though this novel is long, drawn out, and sometimes hard to follow - this book is still so much better than all the new canon books, and the other Legends books.  In this Thrawn series, the author took risks, had original new ideas, and actually did something with the characters.  You will never see another Star Wars novel like these Thrawn books.  All the new novels do is just play it safe; never advancing any serious Star Wars stories.  Bravo, Timothy Zahn!",4,"US"
2012-10-01,"A Thrilling Conclusion!","The Last Command is the third book of the Trawn trilogy, which takes place a few years after ""Return of the Jedi"". In this final installment of the series, full-scale war has reignited in multiple sectors acoss the galaxy, and the Empire is regaining control of planets necessary for reestablishing system dominance. The brilliant part about this final book is we get to see Grand Admiral Thrawn demonstrate his full tactical genius in combat as the Empires chief of command. Not only has be managed to make massive restorations to the empires fleet through expert covert operations resolved at the end of  the second book, ""Dark Force Rising"", he is also able to utilize his gains with surgical precision and efficiency. My favorite part is that Thrawn establishes himself as a villain that you come to respect and believe in! Not only is he clever and effective he is also respectful to his crew and subordinates. One may argue that this is because the insane Jedi Master C'baoth is seeking to gain supremacy over the Empire and establish himself as the new emperor. Thrawn is placed in a difficult position of having to guarantee the loyalty of his soldiers by maintaining troop morale, and establishing mutual respect while C'boath uses his dark powers of manipulation in an attempt to subvert Thrawn's hard-earned authority. This is, by far the most complex and compelling villain dynamic I have yet seen in a star wars storyline!The situation with the rebels is also brilliantly executed. Mara Jade must carefully navigate her shifting allegiances as she struggles with her own challenges both internally and with her continually shifting circumstances. She must find a way to resolve the awful spell that palatine beset upon her, compelling her to kill Luke Skywalker in vengeance. She also doesn't exactly like Luke, because the death of the emperor terminated her previous position as hand to the empire, which was considerably lucrative. All of this occurred years ago, and Mara is beginning to process this anguish, which only makes the conflict within her even more difficult. It's far easier for Mara simply to hate Luke, but she finds herself needing his help in this third book, and her situation becomes only more complicated, when the alliance learns of her history with the Empire!Sadly, Winter plays a minimal role in this book. I always found her to be one of the more fascinating characters with her photographic memory. She spends most of her time caring for Leia's child in this book. Leia makes a big power play, going off on a limb to lend aid to the Noghri, a race of short lizard-like aliens that have been loyal to the Empire, but only because of their respect for Lord Vader. Leia uses her investigative and diplomatic skills to utilize this inherited esteem, which ultimately results in significant effects.Many other exciting challenges take place for Luke Skywalker in this book. Master C'boath, Thrawn and a few other surprises along the way keep him more off his feet than usual! There is so much else that happens, that is masterfully resolved in this book it would take too long to describe. The smuggler Talon Karrde attempts to rally the rest of his smuggler associates against the empire, which proves to be a very difficult task. Every storyline in this book is entertaining, and finds a way to wrap itself into the significance of the overall conclusion.  I only had one problem with this book, and it has to do with a rather silly quote in one of the final chapters having to do with Thrawn's fascination with art. You'll know it when you get to it. For that to be one of the only things that really bothered me about the book though is amazing, because I'm usually really picky. This book is defiantly a good pay-off if you weren't as impressed with the first two. Timothy Zahn makes this one count, and puts in a lot of great moments as well as excellent conclusions.",5,"US"
2017-06-16,"Excellent","This series is great. The author did a masterful job of telling what happens after the Emperor falls and how the last of his Empire fight for what they feel is right and how the New Republic forms amongst all that drama. I recommend all Star Wars fans to read this series.",5,"US"
2014-09-24,"BEST STAR WARS BOOK EVER!!!!!!","the reason I'm giving this book the 5 star is simply out of appreciation for the author's fantastic work. Like all the books of the Thrawn Trilogy, it was fast-paced, witty, action-packed, and compelling. Everything in the Star Wars we know and love. This one however eclipsed the past two completely. The conclusion involved the internal struggle of Mara Jade as she wrestles with the decision of fulfilling her dead master's last command and Luke prepares for his final battle with the psychotic dark jedi Joruus C'baoth. The battle against the empire seemed hopeless as we keep seeing the new republic pounded by Thrawn's clone troopers and dark force fleet to the point where the reader thinks: Are they going to do it? Will the New Republic prevail? What's going to happen?! Zahn does a good job of building up all this hatred toward C'aboth and yet understanding why he is what he is. I liked seeing what was happening in both fleets and every move they pulled. Nice that the military theme in Star Wars was expressed. Something that was glossed over in other books. Last thing, my most favorite part of the book was the events speeding up to the end and the most epic conclusion in science fiction; including the last battle against C'baoth which brings out a big surprise. I won't give spoilers but I'll give you a hint: A duel of the soul in a dark cave. Thank you Timothy Zahn for writing such a great book worthy of Star Wars! Thank you and may the force be with you!!!",5,"US"
2011-10-23,"Review of the Kindle version","For days, I have been trapped in the Star Wars universe reading Timothy Zahn's trilogy.  My poor husband had to suffer from me reading The Last Command (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 3) through the night.  All I can say is WOW.Zahn once again recreates the Star Wars universe in all its glory.  All the main characters remain true to themselves and maturing as we would expect.  Leia and Han are parents, Luke is all grown up.  Lando is becoming much more likeable (I never did like him in the movies).I can honestly say I'm not crazy about the ysalamari or C'baoth, although I guess it's better to make the Master insane than be someone we have to take seriously.Thrawn redeemed himself to me.  I can finally accept him as Grand Admiral, ironically because of what happens to him at the end.  Up until that point, I felt his portrayal was a little unreal.  II'm in love with the interplay between Mara and Luke.  It was brilliantly crafted.  This is why the Star Wars movies were so successful -- the interaction between the characters.  Zahn brings it all back.  Hints and allusions weaving in and out of the story.  I knew it from the beginning.  Mara Jade is undeniably the best addition to the Star Wars universe.  I absolutely adore her.  Pair her with Luke and it's magic.I'm so glad Zahn was picked to do this trilogy.  He brought back the characters we all know and love in a way very few authors ever could.  This last book ties up some loose ends; but it thankfully leaves a lot more to explore, which is why I'm off to read the ""Hand of Thrawn"" duology.(If you're thinking about the Kindle version, it is mostly well formatted with a few spelling/grammatical errors and some spacing problems.  For the most part, those things did not detract much from my reading experience.)",5,"US"
2013-08-14,"Yagyu review","This was an amazing book. A wonderful end to an amazing trilogy.Pros:1: It was so Artfully done. This is actually a quote from Thrawn at the end but once you read it and see why he said it, im sure you will agree.2: C'baoth. Joruus C'baoth reaches his peak insanity and lets the darkside fully consume him making for a great villain and successor to Palpatine.3: Mara Jade. She really shines here in this book and overcomes allot of the brain washing that Palpatine did to her.4: Luke and Luuke. Luke feels about right in this, hes still trying to save rather then kill which makes sense and follows his character well in return of the Jedi.5: Noghri. They really get awesome in this book and we see them get some justice.Cons:1: Luke and Luuke? Theres a clone and the spelling of the name well yeah, just like the C'baoth clone its spelling is a little annoying. I love Zahns writing but i think saying so and so's clone would have been better then just doubling a letter in the name.2: No grand lightsaber duel. Well technically this isnt true, Mara and Luke do get to use their sabers. But I really wanted to see C'baoth's skill with a Lightsaber.Nothing really else bad to say about the book. Its an awesome read. So go check it out!!!",5,"US"
2017-12-17,"Legends should be canon","After seeing the latest movie, I am sad to say that Disney is killing the Star Wars of my youth.  These stories, ""Legends"" as they are now called, are so much better and it is sad that they are not canon. They understand what it means to be Star Wars and captures it nearly perfectly.",5,"US"
2018-01-17,"Exciting","This is a really good Star Wars novel, the culmination of the series is fast paced and exciting. It is nicely written and enjoyable. The only reason why I dont give it 5 stars is because it seems to use too many of the story elements from other Star Wars stories for my liking, mainly Return of the Jedi, so a little deduction for that.",4,"US"
2013-09-11,"The Climatic Finish","In this final episode of the Thrawn Trilogy, we watch as the questionable choices that Leia, Han, and Lando made come to fruition. During the previous two books, we watched this trio make choices that seemed very risky and its in this book that we watch the pieces of the puzzle fall into place.  The brilliant Grand Admiral Thrawn seems to out smart the Republic at every turn, and it's only through the culmination of fringe efforts that defy logic, and the growing strife between the Admiral and Jedi Master Cboath that the Empire can be stopped.",5,"US"
2014-12-06,"Great series, really captures that classic Star Wars magic","This series is awesome. If you are on the fence go for it. Fans of the original trilogy will dig it for sure and this last book might be the best one. Great ending in my opinion. This really has that Star Wars ""magic"" and feel to it. Great writing and characters. I was weird about reading them because  Episode 7 is coming out soon and it will not follow this as the Expanded Universe is not canon but I don't regret it one bit. I believe that DIsney and Abrams are doing a great job with the new Star Wars from what I have read and seen and I am confident that I will be able to enjoy that story in conjunction with this one even though they are not about the same characters. Check it out!",5,"US"
2014-01-05,"Great final book to the 'Thrawn' trilogy","Third and lat book of the 'Thrawn' trilogy, the entire set tells weaves a mighty fine story throughout the three books. Zahn has done a superb job on this story. It's adventuresome, fun, filled with well fleshed-out charcters, and vey intelligent. Never dull and nicely paced I found it hard to put down. Didn't want the books to come to an end.Space battles, new and powerful enemies, intrigue in the New Republic government and old grudges to be settled. All the gang is here and they're very entertaining!These three books are the best of all the supplemental SW books, in my opinion of course.",5,"US"

2000-07-16,"Audio Rendition is Excellent","Timothy Zahn tops himself with a slap bang ending to this Star Wars saga.  There is not much I can add to other reviews.  However, the audio book is abridged and some of the story seems to skip forward at high speed.  Once  again Anthony Daniels (C3PO) does a great job reading.  His voice  characterizations are the same as in ""Dark Force Rising"" allowing  the listener to keep the many characters straight and concentrate on the  plot(s).  The audio and special effects are crisp and clear and easily  understood in a car environment.  The best of the three books and well  worth the purchase price.  Run time:  180 minutes.",5,"US"
2013-03-31,"Excellent and leaves you wishing for more.","Strongly recommended.  Zahn's writing captures the feel of the movies and Star Wars universe. This was the Star Was expanded universe before Lucas let it run amuck with ever growing numbers of basically lousy writing and poorly thought-out continuations.  You feel these stories fit well and would have made excellent movies.  You don't have over-the-top characters like the Vong or million ship mega battles that simply feel like cop-out rather than well considered Star Wars scenarios.",5,"US"

2016-06-05,"Well worth a read.","A fitting finish to a superb series. Zahn is an excellent writer, and proves it here. There are no loose ends, and he manages to keep you so focused on the penultimate showdown, that you are unaware of each closing minor plotline.",5,"US"
2015-11-24,"I really enjoyed this entire trilogy","I really enjoyed this entire trilogy.  I read these based on a recommendation of a friend and I'm glad I did.  These are the first Star Wars books that I read and I'd recommend them to anyone who is wanting to jump out a little into the extended universe of Star Wars.",5,"US"
2018-01-18,"Wonderfully gripping!","Zahn's books capture the essence of Lucas' Star Wars in this continuation of the story five years after the destruction of the second Death Star. Follow Luke, Leia, Han and many other characters known and loved in the Star Wars universe as they meet new allies and enemies alike and face challenges which threaten to destroy the fledgling New Republic. A must read for Star Wars fans young and old.",5,"US"

2013-07-15,"A Jump to Lightspeed","What person that grew up in the 20th century doesn't like Star Wars? Most people that you encounter would claim to be some type of Star Wars fan. I was always enthralled by George Lucas's groundbreaking films, but it wasn't until I read Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy that I became a genuine Star War's fanatic. Zahn captures the audience in the first book of his three part series and doesn't not fail to keep the reader entranced throughout the conclusion of The Last Command.  Zahn's mastery of the art of suspense will keep any reader engaged and captivated, whether he or she is a novice Star War's fan, as I was, or a seasoned Star War's fanatic. After reading The Last command, I could not get enough of the world of Star Wars. Timothy Zahn's The Last Command is a must read for anyone who claims to love Star Wars.I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did and I hope that you will be encouraged by Zahn to further explore the intricate galaxy of Star Wars.",5,"US"
2015-10-08,"Star Wars: The Last Command book 3 of 3","1) Grand Admiral Thrawn. 2) Cloned Jedi Master. 3) Mara Jade. This takes place after the original trilogy and kicks so much butt, that everything Star Wars is held up to The Thrawn Trilogy. If you like reading and like Star Wars, you totally need this book.",5,"US"
2017-10-16,"An intense conclusion to a beautifully crafted trilogy.","The Last Command did not fail to deliver in closing another fantastic series by Zahn. It kept me hooked the whole way through.",5,"US"
2013-03-06,"Awesome","Awesome awesome! This book was so good i almost cant believe it. Once again luke and the new republic are in a dire situation. This book is why science fiction was created. If you dont buy this book now you are stupid! Spoilers: (if you have not read this book stop now!) Thrawn is a nice change of pace for a villain. I mean you always gotta have a (dark sider) in there some place but an evil genius admiral works too. All the old gangs here from 4 5 6. If you watched starwars as a kid then this book is cannon for the star wars die hards. If they make another movie these are my bet. Mara jade is a great anti-heroin.",5,"US"
2011-05-31,"The Strongest of Three Books","This was the best of the Thrawn Trilogy and actually manages to expand the Star Wars Universe.  This book does come dangerously close to being a clone of Return of The Jedi, but keeps it different enough that, just when you think you've been down this road before, something new and interesting happens.  I particularly like the plot line dealing with the smugglers.  Certainly better than overall than the first 2 books and it seems like the author was having a lot for fun while writing this volume.",4,"US"
2014-01-11,"Withdrawal","Great finish to the trilogy. Should be the next three to be made instead of what seems like three separate storylines. Thrawn would go great with the new wave of calm cool classy collected and sophisticated bad guys. As for withdrawal, I'm busy, and this trilogy has been my mental breaks.  Hopefully there will be some relief in the extended universe.",4,"US"

2016-06-05,"Thrawn Trilogy: The Conclusion","This book was more fast paced than it's two predecessors, not saying they were slow it's just a mark of all that happened in this one. The story begins and is pretty much non-stop until the end... It was a very good conclusion to the trilogy and wraps the whole Thrawn thing up very nicely... Whilst, however, leaving the ending ambiguous and ready for more books. Great read, both the book and the trilogy!",5,"US"

2016-06-23,"Good Series","Still reading it. The writer repeats some of his sayings and Thrawn is sometimes too good at predicting what the rebels are going to do through out the series but all in all I have enjoyed the series and should have this book finished soon. Now have to find what I want to read next!",5,"US"
2017-07-25,"Worth the price and family friendly","I really enjoyed this series. There is no bad language or content. For anyone who cares what they read, this is a winner. Why can't all stories be written as well?",5,"US"
2016-10-16,"A Great Start to the EU","**SPOILERS**In the Thrawn Trilogy, Timothy Zahn kicks off the EU proper with a trilogy usually regarded as one of the EU's high points--and with good reason. Zahn definitely has a feel for Star Wars and his writing is perfectly suited for the task at hand. Thrawn is an extremely compelling character, as is Palleon. Jorus C'boath is another interesting character, and Mara Jade is downright essential. Most good EU novels will follow the same sort of direction as what Zahn did in the Thrawn trilogy, and characters from these books will pop up time and time again in subsequent EU books.This book however confused me upon first reading. I did not understand that Luuke and Luuuke were clones of Luke. I literally thought this was an editing error. Keep this in mind and you will avoid that confusion!",5,"US"
2017-11-28,"Best book in the trilogy","This was a good conclusion to the thrawn trilogy. Its worth the read and too bad they didnt use this trilogy for the new movies",4,"US"
2016-03-02,"This was a good book series to me except for this book","This was a good book series to me except for this book. I felt like the pacing was all off. It felt to me like he was going to write a 4th book, found out that no this was going to be it and then tried to cut off too many plot lines in the last few chapters.",3,"US"
2015-08-24,"Just ok","Too many plot lines went nowhere and the heroes are always acting like idiots but miraculously overcoming impossible odds. Read it if you read the other two but don't expect too much.",3,"US"
2013-06-17,"Book Editing Is Problematic","I enjoyed reading ""Star Wars, The Last Command,"" by Timothy Zahn. Unfortunately, there seems to be a real problem with the editing of this final book in a 3-book series. Commas where they shouldn't be, periods in the middle of sentences, quite a number of contractions missing the apostrophe (well instead of we'll, for example), chapter headings broken and text warped to the next line, improper use of ""an/or."" As a published Author myself, I don't doubt I may notice something like this more than a casual reader, but these punctuation problems were numerous enough for me to ding the book one star for that alone. I utilize a professional production company to review/edit my work during the conversion process to Kindle files or hard-copy format. I had heard that the Amazon.com conversion program was not 100% reliable and could return such problems, and this was confirmed when a friend in writing sent me her Amazon.com 'converted' manuscript and I found numerous similar errors present. Not that I believe Mr. Zahn has used that app - I don't know personally who he uses for editing, but he needs to have a talk with them this time around.As to the story line itself...Zahn has done an admirable job of character interaction, with interplay between Grand Admiral Thrawn, Captain Pellaeon, Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade, et al, coming across quite deliciously with interesting plot twists.However, it seems trite that just about everything and anything written in Sci-fi nowadays always has ""the fate of the galaxy"" as its central theme.  It would be refreshing to have some of these characters fighting something different for a change.",4,"US"
2015-03-07,"The Thrawn Trilogy Goes out with a BANG!","If you have read the previous books, The Last Command is a MUST read. It is better than Heir to the Empire and Dark Forces Rising and is pretty much the perfect read. I loved everything about it. Great work Timothy Zahn!",5,"US"

2017-06-04,"Thrawn series","Whether Tim Zahn wrote the Thrawn canon or the other way around, these 3 books were awesome! Zahn truly gets the 'persona and characteristics' of the characters and does a masterpiece using them in writing the stories, with great action that makes sense. Also being a Star Wars Rebels TV series fan, he captures Thrawn's psyche perfectly. I also highly recommend the 'Thrawn' book which covers the discovery and rise of Thrawn.Only frustrating thing is Disney introducing 'Ben' as the only kid of Solo and Leia in the Episode 7 'movie'.  But in the books, she has 'twins' (Jacen and Jaina). Confuse the audience bs! If Disney owns 'the rights', is anyone even overseeing continuity?!?",5,"US"

2012-04-09,"Thrawn Is Shown To Have Life Merely To Die...","Ugh, I can't wait for Joruus to *finally* be silenced! The more he postures and threatens the more I support Thrawn. I'm also not keen that Joruus was able to manipulate/fool Gilad's memory so easily. The Mind Trick works with the *weak-minded*. Gilad may be presented as rather slow on the uptake but I think it's merely Zahn saying How awesome is Thrawn! I actually do quite like the Chiss. Yet, I wish Zahn's preference for Thrawn and Mara *didn't* equal that everyone else gets shafted, but it does. :(If the Force Lizards are so great, how come Joruus, who couldn't be a Jedi, not with his temperament--he's worse than Anakin!--can still do battle meditation? If the lizards nullify the Force, he shouldn't be able to do any Jedi abilities. Consistency would be appreciated.Wow, I truly am impressed. Thrawn actually moves a bit and feels emotion and reacts a bit in Last Command! About time.  I like that he's a thoughtful villain--they are very rare--but the fact that almost nothing *moves* Thrawn makes him hard to relate to and read. Glad to see a bit of Csilla's ice is finally beginning to thaw.The typos found in the text of all three TTT novels really make it hard to believe that Zahn's characters are as intelligent as he never tires of telling the reader they are. Thrawn is a smart guy. However, come on, he's been speaking Basic for years now. Tensing issues should be non-existent. But, I blame the editor for not catching it, not Thrawn.Way to hand out a compliment and a promotion, Thrawn! Scare the poor pup out of his mind that you mean to kill him for `letting' Luke escape then give him a huge sideways compliment. Effective and unexpected.Wow, how sad. Four books building his favorite OC and in two sentences, Thrawn's dead? That seems cheap somehow. Poor Gilad.Though I usually don't ignore 3/5ths of a book, focusing on one thread, I'm glad I did in TLC. Frankly, everyone but Gilad, Thrawn, and a few of the Imperial crewers are completely devoid of any life or color whatsoever.Mara's arc is so unbelievable I didn't even bother reading most of it. Killing a clone of Luke did *not* fulfill her 'last command'. Nor does her suddenly trusting her arch enemy make *any* sense. For the life of me, I can't see how so many can just fall in line thinking Luke and Mara are the perfect couple, either. I'm all for dark ones being redeemed and finding love but come on, be realistic a bit.Anyways, on to SotP!",3,"US"

I forced my way through pretty much the whole thing, just because I had heard and read for so long that it was so great. Well, it isn't even mediocre. The characters are dull, Zahn gets too caught up describing military maneuvers and technology, and the main villain (Thrawn) over and over and over again just figures out exactly what his opponents are going to do without any real data or clues. There's no real, true tension, and there's no mythology at all. Just stay away from these overrated books.",2,"US"
2016-03-20,"Fitting Conclusion to the Thrawn Trilogy","Here we come to the final installment of the Thrawn Trilogy as Zahns series of novels have come to be known. Its a largely satisfactory ending aided by Zahns deft plotting and ear for the dialogue and cadence of Luke, Leia, and Han. In the previous installment, Dark Force Rising, Grand Admiral Thrawn had not only gained control over the Katana Fleet, a fleet of ships thought to have been lost or destroyed, but also started manufacturing cloned soldiers to man those ships, shifting the balance of power in the galaxy in the process. Thrawns bolstered forces make the Empire a reinvigorated adversary, and Zahn smartly accomplishes this without using another superweapon as a crutch. While the New Republic deals with this new threat, Leia prepares the birth of her twins and Luke questions which side Mara Jade, former assassin for the Emperor turned smuggler, will ultimately join. In the first part of the novel, Luke conscripts Talon Karrde into helping him track troop movements for the New Republic. Karrde, a smuggler with a heart of gold, stands as one of Zahns more indelible creations, and here he showcases Zahns ability to invest his plots with clever moves and countermoves. In fact, Karrdes subplot might be my favorite element of the entire novel. He must form a shaky alliance between normally competitive smugglers in order to provide Luke and the New Republic with the intelligence they seek while also keep an eye on Thrawns attempts at seeding dissention within the group. Zahns other and more popular contribution to the wider Star Wars Expanded Universe is of course Mara Jade, a Force sensitive former assassin for the Empire.  Throughout the trilogy, she seems hell bent on finally killing Luke who she blames for the death of the Emperor. In a risky move, Luke decides to trust her and bring her along on their mission to destroy Thrawns hidden cloning facilities. Because of Jades work with the Empire, shes the only person with enough knowledge to lead Luke, Han, and the rest to where the clones are being produced en masse. They even defy the New Republic by sneaking Jade off of Coruscant where she has been detained because of her ties to the Emperor and newly discovered evidence that points to current collaboration with the Empire. Jade has apparently become a fan favorite character, and she gives us another fully rounded female character other than Leia, something Star Wars needs more of. Shes an intriguing character because she seems to have lost her place in the world following the death of the Emperor. But it is a little silly how quickly Luke decides to trust her, especially considering the fact that she openly states multiple times that she plans on killing him. In fact, were just supposed to trust her because Zahn has decided that shes going to be one of the good guys, which kind of sandpapers her edges in a way that makes her character less interesting. When the New Republic detains her because they receive information from an Imperial agent that shes still working for the Empire, Han steadfastly defends her innocence merely because the agent is likely untrustworthy. Sure, but if were going to think about the issue rationally, it would be idiotic for New Republic to allow a potential Imperial spy and former aid to the Emperor to freely move about their government headquarters. Zahn seems to ask us to trust Mara simply because he knows in the end shes one of the good ones. Its interesting to see ways in which The Last Command contradicts canonical information from subsequent films. Bringing in the idea of clones, which at this point were nothing more than a quick allusion by Obi-Wan in A New Hope, smartly unweaves the seemingly definitive conclusion to the Empire at the Battle of Endor. But its suggested in the novel that the cloning process means the clones go insane after a couple of years, information completely missing from the prequels, likely because Lucas decided to just ignore this version of events. Its a nice example of how the Star Wars EU never truly was canon. (Theres also no mention of Kamino as you might guess). Eventually, Luke and Mara face off against insane Jedi clone Cbaoth while the forces of Admiral Ackbar try to survive one of Thrawns traps. The novel ends with the remnants of the Empire more powerful and the New Republic a little weaker, a finale that guarantees the detente will continue. The expansive Star Wars EU wouldnt have had the impact that it did without Zahns trilogy. He clearly understood Lucass creation, and when reading his novels, I often felt like I was visiting old friends.",4,"US"
2016-06-12,"But it was so artistically done","The Last Command - in which Jedi twins are born, smugglers are allied, and insane clones are faced down - concludes Zahn's Thrawn trilogy with all the bang you could hope to get from your buck, even if that title did leave me humming Europe's ""The Final Countdown"" for three days.If you haven't been a fan of this series thus far, there's likely nothing I can say here to change your mind. Zahn's still treating intergalactic politics as if it were as exciting as soapy space battles, which does it for me but may not be your cuppa, though as all the author's tight plotting comes to fruition in this novel there is significantly more of the latter than in previous volumes. My main retroactive quibble with this series is its lack of cast diversity - which, to be fair, was not a thing that was really foregrounded in the early 1990s when these books were written - but the total girl power ending to this volume acted as a bit of a balm. (No, really, go back and read that final confrontation again and realize who did all the heavy lifting.)The only truly heartbreaking thing about The Last Command is that it marks the end of Thrawn, who remains one of the best villains I've ever read. (In case you're listening, Timothy Zahn, I would read an entire series on Thrawn. And watch Thrawn movies. Possibly buy a lunchbox.) His departure brings to a close the best trilogy in the 'verse, but remains bittersweet - even if it was so artistically done.",5,"US"
2007-02-09,"Sprint to the End.","Remember Star Wars?  Not that joke of a series that came out with the most recent three movies, but instead that sometimes hokey, sometimes brilliant, always engrossing space opera from the seventies.  Luke Skywalker, hero for millions of boys, Han Solo, dreamed of by girls everywhere, and Darth Vader, feared by all.  That's the series that changed science fiction.  Timothy Zahn loved those movies as much as I did.  Timothy Zahn stayed true to that vision where George Lucas didn't.  The Last Command (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 3) is the conclusion of the best Star Wars story since we first met Luke and Han Solo.As should be, the book is action from beginning to end, but that action is varied and tense.  From light saber duels to Horatio Hornblower sea battles in space to political intrigue and obsessed vindettas.The new characters feel like they were just off camera when Lucas filmed the original movies.  Mara Jade has dreams of fighting Luke.  She's an enforcer for a brilliant smuggler, Talon Kardde.  Talon is a political animal, playing alliances and allegiances like chess moves while remaining likable and understandable.The greatest addition of all is our true villain, Grand Admiral Thrawn.  The reader understands that it's a good thing that Thrawn wasn't around for the rebel victories over the Emperor because the result would have been different.  He's a mastermind, both strategically and tactically, and can only be defeated by underhanded means or overwhelming force.To complicate matters, Thrawn's ally, the insane Joruus C'baoth, is a dark Jedi master trying to turn Luke to the dark side and to possess Leia's children, raising them as the seed to a new  Jedi army.The action doesn't stop and the ending is fantastic.  Pick it up, enjoy it, and remember those good old days. - CV Rick",5,"US"
2010-04-12,"""Your destiny is in your heands...in the end you're the one who makes the decisions""","""Your destiny is in your heands...in the end you're the one who makes the decisions""The final entry in the esteemed Thrawn Trilogy!The Katana fleet is Thrawn's and he has been using it quite liberally--along with a new breed of clones--to slow take back all the ground lost to the New Republic.  The New Republic is scrambling desperately, but to no hope.  The Republic's only chance of warding off the Empire is to destroy the unending supply of Imperial clones.  And it will take the collaboration of long-time enemies to win.NOTE: Spoilers from the previous two novels may appear.I Liked:Another tough section to write as I want to include everything from the previous two novels!In this third book, Zahn steps up the threat of Thrawn by allowing him to capture the Katana fleet and be successful in his takeover of worlds.  Too often, a villain is ""dangerous"" or ""evil"" because the author writes it.  But the villain never does anything that really threatens the heroes and makes the reader wonder who will come out on top.  This is certainly not so with The Last Command.  I was a bit worried earlier on in the trilogy, when Thrawn's expertise was lauded and yet he seemed to fail at every venue.  While this was notable in making Thrawn fallible, it was also possibly hurting his reputation and believability as a true villain.  I shouldn't have worried.  Zahn followed up with a nice little win for Thrawn, and now the stakes are truly high and our heroes do have something real to worry over.I've talked endlessly about the characters, Luke, Leia, and Han, so I won't really add anything, other than they are, as always, fabulous.  I also love how Zahn gets the credit for creating the Solo twins, who would make such an impression in the New Jedi Order and the Legacy of the Force series.  But I also love the path that Mara's story is taking.  In many ways, the Thrawn trilogy is her trilogy.  She grows, from a nomadic smuggler, running from her past, to a Rebel embracing her future.  Mara realizes the Empire is dead and will never return, that the Emperor may not have always told the truth, and perhaps she doesn't want to kill Luke after all.  Her growth in this trilogy is truly amazing.  And while she does tread the Mary Sue line, well, I can handle it.I really like how Zahn brought in the clones and references to the Clone Wars.  While much of our knowledge of the Clone Wars has changed with the prequels, I like seeing how his ideas still fit or can be worked into the ""new"" universe.  It's also interesting to think about how the Force behaves around clones.  I hope someone gets a chance to talk about that.Also, I applaud Zahn for his nice, crisp conclusion.  Not too long and preachy, hopeful, yet tinged with solemnity.  The universe has been saved...but the New Republic still has a long way to go.I Didn't Like:I really have to be nit-picky yet again in order to come up with anything for this section.While I like the clones, Zahn doesn't give them much of a personality (apparently, a plague of being bred in an ysalamiri environment) nor does he give much indication of what happens to them afterwards.The concept of the ysalamiri even seems to have changed since Heir.  In Heir, Luke never senses the dark void the ysalamiri create, allowing himself to be captured.  Here, Luke and Mara can sense that Mount Tantiss is shrouded in darkness, meaning they wouldn't be able to use the Force.Petty, but I was a little perturbed that the Solo-Skywalker clan can jail-break Mara and receive no repercussions.  Just another thing that makes me wonder if the New Republic is going to be quickly corrupted.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:None.Leia gives birth to her twins and breast-feeds them.Several characters die.  Luke, Han, Lando, Chewie, and Mara are sent to Wayland to destroy the cloning facility.Overall:Some things age well with time, others don't.  I've read a few older Star Wars novels that just haven't quite stood the test of time.  I can happily state that the Thrawn Trilogy isn't one of them.As a review of both the last book and the series as a whole, the Thrawn Trilogy is in short brilliant.  There is no doubt at all that this is Star Wars.  Lightsaber battles, Jedis, Imperials, smugglers, new worlds, new aliens, new technologies, new characters, Han, Luke, Leia, the Force...all are here and are masterfully written.  The minute you begin reading, you are enveloped in the world and are startled when you realize you are reading Star Wars and not watching the movies!  I cannot give these novels enough praise.  If you are a Star Wars fan, these need to be the first novels you read.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",5,"US"
2012-04-19,"A great Last Command Kill Luke Skywalker, makes a great final chapter","This book really came together and tied everything from books one and two.  I loved all the intrigue in this book, it's full of different agenda's and they all come together at the end.  The best is Karde's smugglers and Wedge's Rouge squad and how they told each other half truth's cause they didn't know that the could trust each other, and they inadvertently end up helping each other's causes.I love where the Mara Jade story went with her destiny to kill Luke Skywalker, as the Emperor's  Last Command, and the only way to get the Emperor out of her head is to complete the task.Jormark C'Boath has a nice arc, I love the scene's with him and Thrawn each testing themselves, I could have read more of those.I really dug the references to the Clone Wars and the new coming of the clone wars on the horizon.Chewbacca is the stand out from the original star wars crew, the scene's where he think's he has failed his life debt are really great, how he his truly ready to give up his life for the Solo family.I recommend this trilogy it's almost twenty years old and it still holds up to this day, I've heard a lot of hype about this novel and I have to say it exceeded my expectations.",5,"US"
2009-01-25,"Great trilogy! Outstanding climax!","The Thrawn Trilogy by Timothy Zahn is certainly one of the best series in the Star Wars realm. The Last Command is the third book and likely the best, even though the first two are excellent. Grand Admiral Thrawn is one of the best characters ever even if he is on the wrong side. His intelligence, military acumen, and sense of anticipation are unsurpassed. He presents a genuine threat to the Republic forces, and he is great fun to watch in action.The Last Command manages to keep several different, but related stories going throughout the book without confusing the reader. First and foremost, Thrawn has set his sights on destroying the Republic forces and ruling a new Empire. Such an action appears to be well within his capabilities. Second, the rogue Jedi Joruus C'baoth is convinced that he will be the next ruler of the Empire and that Luke, Leia, and Leia's twins will switch to his side and help him fulfill his mission. Third, Mara Jade continues her efforts to understand her true purpose and whether or not she is irrevocably bound to the command in her head that tells her she is to kill Luke Skywalker. Fourth, the smuggler Talon Karrde again plays a major role in this book. He is uncertain of where his loyalties should lie and believes that he only wants to remain neutral and profitable. He quickly discovers that neutrality is just an academic concept if Thrawn thinks your services will be useful to him.The characters in the Thrawn Trilogy are excellent. Of course, we have most of our heroes from the films, plus Thrawn, C'baoth, Karrde, and Mara Jade. During the trilogy we also are introduced to the alien species Noghri. The Empire mistreated them for years, and some of their best warriors were forced to leave their home planet and fight for Thrawn's forces. One actually serves as Thrawn's personal bodyguard. Leia has worked with them so they will understand how the Empire treated them, and she has met with success. The Noghri turn out to be invaluable as security for Han and Leia's twins and also play a huge role in the book's climactic battle.The action moves back and forth from space to Coruscant to Wayland (location of Palpatine's personal storeroom) to the Bilbringi shipyards. The book is paced with surprises and great action. The Thrawn Trilogy is one you will not want to miss, and The Last Command is particularly good.",5,"US"
2008-08-25,"Spot on climax to a great trilogy","The Last Command is the climactic novel in Timothy Zahn's superb Thrawn Trilogy, a series published in the early 1990's that laid the groundwork for much of the Star Wars Expanded Universe that was to come. All of Zahn's carefully constructed plotting comes together here in an action-packed and highly rewarding tale, intertwining the militaristic and precise storyline of Grand Admiral's Thrawn's campaign against the New Republic with the more metaphysical struggles of Luke Skywalker and insane Jedi clone Joruus C'baoth. All the main characters from the Original Trilogy take starring roles alongside Thrawn, C'baoth, smuggler Talon Karrde and ex-Emperor's Hand Mara Jade.Grand Admiral Thrawn has built the armies and resources he requires for a full-out assault on the New Republic. Key to his plans are the clone army he's creating out of Spaarti cylinders, his newly-acquired Katana fleet of Clone Wars-era dreadnoughts, and cloaking shield technology taken from the Emperor's private storehouse of treasures and technology on the hidden planet Wayland. Thrawn's plans for disabling Coruscant are innovative and quite unexpected, making extremely good use of the cloaking shields. As in the first two books, he is generally a step ahead of his opponents, using his careful analysis of people and cultures' artworks to gain a heightened understanding of their motivations and likely courses of action. For some, Zahn's portrayal of Thrawn might verge too close to making him omniscient, but several key errors act to humanize (""Chiss-ize?"") the Grand Admiral and make him more believable. To me personally, Thrawn is one of the most intriguing and entertaining villains in all of the Star Wars stories.Significant portions of this story focus on Talon Karrde and his efforts to unite disparate bands of smugglers against the Empire. Karrde's journey finally takes on aspects of Han Solo's from the films, as Karrde discovers a wellspring of goodness within himself and is finally able to put profit behind helping people and saving the galaxy. It's interesting learning about the struggles for power between the smugglers after the untimely demise of Jabba the Hutt, and the scenes in which Karrde is double-crossed as he attempts to persuade his peers to his side are quite gripping.Luke has come to terms with his disappointment at learning that C'baoth is a power-hungry and insane clone of the real Jedi Master, and in this final volume he takes a more proactive role to set things right. Echoing the days of being Rebels fighting a guerilla war against the Imperials, Luke and his friends violate all sorts of rules to break Mara out of imprisonment on Coruscant and use her to get to Wayland and set the stage for the final confrontation with C'baoth. For her part, Mara must deal with the titular last command of the Emperor's implanted in her head, ordering her to kill Luke Skywalker. Zahn's way of permitting her to deal with this imperative and simultaneously allowing Luke to live is quite unexpected.Of the three books, this one has the most material that is in conflict with the prequel films and later EU, but for the most part everything still hangs together well enough. The clones are portrayed as far more unstable than the ones we met in the films and none of them show any evidence of individual personalities here. There are some timeline things that are a little off, but again, the overall feel of Zahn's story works just fine with everything that has come since.The Thrawn Trilogy is a terrific Star Wars reading experience and fundamentally important to understanding the Bantam series of novels published throughout the 1990s. Zahn continued on to write quite a few more Star Wars novels, fleshing out the stories of Outbound Flight, Mara Jade, and the enigmatic Hand of Thrawn. Highly recommended!",5,"US"
2014-12-17,"Trilogy Completion","Trilogy completed -I will say this, i am happy with the way things did resolve, overall - I have a small disappointment to the end of Thrawn himself, however, it is a logical conclusion, so okay.I do like the end to the Emperor-Mara Jade story-line, as well as the Luke-Mara Jade story-line.The most important thing in a trilogy is that the major story-lines are wrapped up which they were, and the minor ones had enough to conclude themselves, which, I felt that maybe the page count got in the way of some cleaner wrap up moments, but good enough for non-canon expanded universe.Overall, i am happy with this trilogy and would recommend it to fans of the original trilogy looking to segue into expanded universe novels.",4,"US"
2005-09-19,"sets the stage for all Star Wars novels to come","""The Last Command"" is the concluding volume of Timothy Zhan's ""Thrawn"" trilogy.  The conclusion of volume two (""Dark Force Rising"") left the Grand Admiral Thrawn in command of most of the legendary Katana Fleet which had been missing since before the Clone Wars.  Thrawn, working with the mad Jedi Clone Joruus C'Baoth, has also reclaimed a stockpile of the Emperor's cloning technology and Thrawn can now command the Katana fleet manned with a clone army.  In short, this is by far the biggest threat that the fledgling New Republic has faced since Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader deposed the Emperor.  The Dark Jedi C'baoth seeks to turn Luke and Leia to the Dark Side and also to raise Leia's soon to be born children has his apprentices.  The threat to the entire galaxy is very real and could touch every planetary system.The good guys will not let this happen so easily, of course.  Luke has an idea what C'baoth is up to and will not stray from the Light.  He will not betray what he believes to be right.  Leia is preparing for the birth of her children and also seeks to protect herself and her children from the constant attacks.  With Han, Lando, and the Droids, they are all working to keep the New Republic together, even with attacks from within.""The Last Command"" spans the galaxy and features grand space battles,  light saber duels, various alien creatures and some political intrigue.  In short, it is everything that a Star Wars novel should be.  Timothy Zahn really set up the Post-Return of the Jedi novels to have quite a storyline and showed the other authors just how to tell a Star Wars story.  By no means is this a perfect novel, and there are parts that drag far more than it should considering that this is Star Wars, but the good far outweighs the bad and the continued development of Mara Jade is a big plus.  The Thrawn Trilogy is perhaps the perfect place to begin reading the Star Wars novels.-Joe Sherry",4,"US"
2004-02-15,"The Final Chapter in a Fantastic Trilogy","In The Last Command, Hugo-award winning author Timothy Zahn pulls out all the stops. Clones, super-weapons, smuggler alliances, alien warriors, Jedi confrontations, it's all here in the brialliant conclusion to the trilogy that arguable matches Lucas's own original in terms of endearing characters, fantastic action, and pure Star Wars feel.Talon Kardde, Mara Jade's smuggler employer, is working to create a coalition between rivals in an attempt to create another unified front on which to fight the expanding forces of Grand Admiral Thrawn. Mara lies wounded in battle on Coruscaunt, her alliances and hatreds torn by old memories and new suspicions. Han, Leia, and Luke, learning of a secret weapons facility on a remote planet, mount a daring operation to take it down, and to make a stand against the insane Jedi Master, Joruus C'baoth.Thrawn's plans, which we see parts of in the first two novels, come to fruition in this third installment, cementing the Grand Admiral's place in the Star Wars pantheon of fantastic villians. A genius and a ruthless commander, he also manages to make us geniunely wonder what would happen should he succeed in bringing the galaxy under his rule.Zahn's talent is incredibly obvious in this. There are moments while reading where you'll notice an event or character development, and remember from two or three books ago when the whole thing was set in motion. Seemingly unimportant events from the first two books suddenly become very relavent showcasing Zahn's genius in both spectacle and subtlety. The entire trilogy really deserves multiple reads, as you're likely to catch something more each time you finish it.And what a finish it is. There is truly no better way to end the wonderful trilogy than with this installment. It's chock-full of all the lightsaber duels and epic space battles you'd expect from a Star Wars story, but also delivers in terms of characters both large and small. Of note is Mara Jade, one of the most complex and entertaining in the SW universe, and a cahracter that has a conclusion that sets up events years in the future.If you are a Star Wars fan and haven't read the Thrawn Trilogy, you owe it to yourself to check it out. If you've read the first two novels, rest assured that this is necessary to complete a wonderful story. And really, above anything else, it's just more fun than you can imagine to pass up.",5,"US"
2003-10-08,"An absolutely PERFECT ending to this Trilogy...","This series started out perfectly with 'Heir to the Empire' and continued perfectly with 'Dark Force Rising' and 'The Last Command' brought it all together, well, perfectly.  Timothy Zahn has absolutely NO equal when it comes to writing Star Wars novels.  He captured the very essence of what made Star Wars so wonderful in the first place.  Great stories with Fantastic characters and wonderfully drawn bad guys & aliens.  All of that continues with 'The Last Command'.  Every time Han, Leia or Luke speak, it sounds as if it were something the REAL characters would've said had this series been made into movies by George Lucas.  But just as important as all of the old characters are developed, Zahn's new creations are just as essential and intricate to the story.  Everyone from Mara Jade to Talon Karrde and his band of smugglers, and possibly the best bad guy created in the Star Wars Universe, Grand Admiral Thrawn.  He's so good at being bad you almost root for the guy--ALMOST.ALL the loose ends are tied up nicely in this last book.  The Nohgri make critical revelations that will turn the tide on the success of the Empire, Mara Jade discovers a way to end her maddening dreams of fighting Luke Skywalker, and how will the Alliance handle a new threat of clones to man the Dark Force of ships recovered at the end of book 2?  Sure, it takes YEARS to amass a number of clones, right?  Or has Thrawn figured a way around that, too?  Discover for yourself why Timothy Zahn has the best reviewed Star Wars books here at amazon.com.  There is a reason why people love his books.  If you are a true Star Wars fan, you should find out for yourself.  I also recommend the Hand of Thrawn 2-book series that Zahn wrote a few years later, and while head & shoulders above the average and even above-average Star Wars fare out there, they too fall short of his original trilogy.  I think I'm going to go out and re-read this series yet again.",5,"US"
2005-11-09,"Concludes One Of Star Wars's Best Sagas In Grand Fashion","The coclusion to the Thrawn Trilogy finds the situation beginning to grow desperate for the New Republic as the Empire - under the leadership of Grand Admiral Thrawn and empowered by recently recovered technology of Emperor Palpatine's, including the cloning devices - continues its devastating resurgence.  Meanwhile Thrawn's ally Jorus C'baoth puts his own plans into full effect, posing a different - and brilliantly unexpected - threat to the Republic.  As well written as ""Heir to The Empire"", ""Last Command"" starts off with the kind of instantly captivating opener that ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" did, and moving through multiple major events in the Star Wars Universe, the book seems to go by quicker than a novel of more than 400 pages should, and brings the trilogy to a masterful conclusion - on a scale on par with the movie endings - while still leaving numerous doors open for the future Star Wars tales to come.  Great characterization, as in the whole trilogy, epic battles, fantastic concepts, and more time to explore the behind-the-scenes diplomatic/political/strategic workings of the conflict, as well as more time for the personal lives of a number of the characters, than the movies generally got to do with their 2 hours or so of running time each.  This book and the trilogy does what the successive movies do - compliment each other's features, provide whatever 'backcompensation' is needed ('The Phantom Menace"", I believe, got a Lot better once you could see it with the retrospect thast comes from seeing Episodes 2 & 3; ""Last Command"" compensates for some minor missteps in ""Dark Force Rising"") and makes the whole Star Wars mythos even better.  Great book!",5,"US"
2009-05-28,"Good Until Near The End","In my view this was one of the best of the Thrawn Trilogy's books, which was in turn one of the best Star Wars novels I've read. It built and built to a very climactic and devastating finish. However, the end is where problems arise for me.The Luke/Mara relationship and their team's work are very quickly skipped over at the end. While I liked how the final battle in the throne room went, the aftermath seemed rushed.However, how Thrawn was dealt with was not good. Thrawn is a character of such excellence and skill that Zahn wrote himself into a hole. There was no logical reason for the Empire to lose that final battle. After spending a quarter of the novel building up this trap, it all ends far too quickly. The betrayal was, I admit, a good idea, building through all three books. However, the suddenness of it happening, and the way the Imperials just turned and fled after the loss of Thrawn reeks of a plot contrivance.I loved Thrawn as a character, and it felt wrong that he was just dispatched so quickly. As I said, it shows that the author had a hole he got himself into. The Republic could not beat the military genius head to head, so he had to call upon the big betrayal. This might well have worked if it was handled better.Overall, I drop it one star for this rushed ending to an otherwise great story.",4,"US"

It was a book that appeared to be longer but it was quicker to read than the previous two. When it was initially released, I had to re-read the previous two chapters since there was a year in between releases. My expectations were met and was not disappointed while reading it, fast pace action and some twists along the way. Storytelling at its best, considered for years as Episodes 7 , 8 and 9 and even before the new Episode 7 hits theaters in 2015 fans we clamoring for Thrawn to make to the screen (we still do and hope it happens). For me the Thrawn Trilogy is the book series that made me rediscover Star Wars and await for more stories to be told",5,"US"
2004-02-24,"Zahn's Best!","Timothy Zahn has written many books, yet his most powerful, most captivating, and most brilliant book would have to be The Last Command.  This is the 3rd book in the Thrawn Trilogy.An important factor of the Thrawn Trilogy is that the remaining Grand Admiral, Grand Admiral Thrawn, hopes to amass an army from the shattered remnants of the Imperial fleet, and with this army crush the young, vulnerable New Republic.  The trilogy takes place five years after ROTJ.Thrawn is a strategic genius.  The Emperor wanted to keep him secret, so he was never discovered.  Thrawn is so brilliant that the rebels  would have been pulverized in the space battle taking place above the moon of Endor.The whole trilogy brings you through breath-taking moments, with so much action it's unbelievable.  Zahn brings the world of Star Wars back so beautifully that you could see this as a movie.There are many awesome moments in the book.  I don't want to give away too much, but Leia gives birth, and a clone of Luke is produced.  It is just as powerful as him, maybe even more.  Luke's severed hand from ESB is found, and it's used to reconstruct him with clone pods found and exploited by Thrawn.  The cloning pods are from AOTC, having been hidden by the Emperor.This book is absolutely wonderful.  I will say that some characters meet untimely demises.  Timothy Zahn reconstructed the whole story with a better, more malevolent villain.  Read these books, AND MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!!",5,"US"
2012-03-18,"Strong finish, if somewhat anti-climatic","!!!!!SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!The Last Command is one of those books that you go into thinking it will be a wild ride.  Sadly, I was a little let down.  The story itself was solid enough but I wasn't ""hooked"" until the last 1/4 of the book.  The first 3/4 of the book was slow and drug slightly but not nearly enough to dampen my experience.  Another gripe is that it is clear this is early in Zahn's career as there were times thoughout the whole trilogy that showcased his writing immaturity.  Most notably would be constantly overusing certain phrases such as ""felt his/her lip twist"" or ""he/she mentally crossed his/her fingers.""The reason I say that the novel is anticlimatic is because I would have had no clue I was getting close to the end had I not had the % on my Kindle displayed.  The last major battle is literally a small conflict over a piece of equipment that the New Republic didn't even need!  I thought that the manner in which Thrawn died was great, but there was NOTHING leading up to it.  For as great and fleshed out as that character was I wished he would have had a more memorably exit.  I also didn't buy Mara Jade easily dispatching clone Luke in 2 seconds, while the JEDI KNIGHT ""real"" Luke had struggled with him the entire fight.With that being said, Zahn captured the Star Wars Universe perfectly.  These characters were clearly the ones that I have grown to love and he somehow found a balance between keeping the characters true to themselves and also developing them as the story went on.  His new characters in Thrawn, Mara Jade, Joruus, and even Pellaeon were all great and felt like they belonged in the Universe.I ended giving this novel a 7/10 which I round up to 4 out of 5 stars because I truely did like the book and would recommend the books to any Star Wars fan.P.S. If I was rating this book on the Kindle transfer it would have been a 3/10 because there were SOOOOO many inexcusable mistakes throughout the entire series.",4,"US"
2008-05-18,"A fitting end to a superb series!","The Last Command wraps up all of the loose ends that were established in the other two novels in the series.  Mara Jade's character is redeemed and from her memorable introduction, to her fight alongside Luke in Myyrkr forest, to her battle with him against C'boath, her character comes full circle and her ties to the Dark Side are finally severed.Having certain plot points established early on helped when the book took some surprising turns!  I was not expecting them and it made this book the most exciting of the three.  I have read many of the Expanded Universe Novels and none of the ones I've read come close to this series.The Star Wars novel franchise is an interesting one, but it holds little interest for me much beyond this time-line in the Star Wars saga.  5 Years after Return of the Jedi is plenty of time to tell a new story about our beloved heroes.  But the Expanded Universe has stretched out into 50 or so years after.  Honestly these poor characters can't live in peace, because the publishers need to sell more novels.  I likely won't be reviewing the other novels as they don't really compare with the ones I've already noted.I apologize for the derailment, but I just needed to share that with those that may have been following my book reviews on Star Wars.  Thanks!  This is a wonderful read and all the character's story arcs are resolved in a exciting and logical fashion.",5,"US"
2000-09-04,"Mediocre at Best","I read ""Heir To The Empire"" when it first came out in the early  90's and was so dissapointed that I never bothered to read to rest of the  series - until now.  I have been so enthralled by ""The New Jedi  Order"" series, that I decided to take another look at Zahn's series.  ""The Last Command"" is by far the best of the three books, but it  still left me with a bad taste in my mouth.I am not impressed with  Zahn's style of writing in this series at all.  It appears to me that he  wrote all three books on a whim and put little, if any, preparation into  his work at all.  The way the characters jumped around from one planet to  the next and then back again reminded me of the fuzzy movement of the  camera in ""The Blair Witch Project.""  I wondered how much more I  would have liked these books had Salvatore, Stackpole, or even Bear written  them.C'Baoth was by far the most idiotic character ever to be introduced  into the Star Wars genre and was the primary reason I couldn't finish the  series origonally.  I found myself thinking less of Luke and Mara because  they had such a tough time defeating him initially. I would have much  rather seen a new villian that was perfectly sane and dripping with evil.  The evil master in this series was nothing more than a bad joke.  Also I  was dissapointed to see a description of Corsecant that had mountains and  wilderness.Some good points:  1) The introduction of Mara Jade.  Zahn  makes up for his idiotic creation of C'Baoth by providing us with our first  look at Mara Jade.  She is a welcome addition to the genre. 2) A glimpse at  the mysterious ""Clone Wars"" - though given the lame description  of Corsecant I wonder how much of it will be applicable in episodes II and  III.",3,"US"
2004-06-28,"the series that revived the Star Wars empire [no spoilers]","""The Last Command"" is the third and final novel in ""The Thrawn Trilogy"" approximately five years following ""Return of the Jedi"".  The originality and creativity in the series is deep, filled with strange creatures and compelling heroes and villains.Grand Admiral Thrawn is an ingenious, calculating and efficient villain, someone the New Republic should fear.  The creative ways he uses items at his disposal are amazing.  Although he is with the Empire, his charisma and composure has me cheering to succeed whenever engaged in combat.  Conversely, the spontaneous ravings of insane Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth form a scary image compared with the serene Emperor.  Smuggler Talon Karrde reminds me of a pre-Rebellion Han Solo but with a Jabba the Hutt sphere of influence.  While Star Wars hasn't been overly political, politics play a minor part in the developments and brings more depth to an otherwise action oriented plot.Action fills the concluding novel, with surprises and well-timed heroics.  I highly recommend this series above all others to any fan of the Star Wars universe.Thank you.",5,"US"
2000-12-11,"What an Excellent book!","I just finished this book last night, and I have to say it was definitely the best of the trilogy.  It was so good I just wanted to stay up all night and read it!  The writeing was great and very discriptive so that I could truly feel what the characters were feeling.  The characters themselves were very well developed, I thought, new and old ones alike.  I'll admit that I really didn't care much for Thrawn in the other two books, because he seemed like just a boring guy who sat in a chair and handed  out orders and looked smart.  It wasn't until this book that I began to realize the extent of his briliance and appreciate him as a villian and as a character.  I was actually sad when he died.  Mara was awesome right from the begining though.  She is definitely one of my favorite characters in the Star Wars universe.  I thought the solution to her problem was ingenous, and I loved the way her character developed over the course of this series, and how it turned out in the end.  This trilogy were definitly the best Star Wars books I have ever read,  and I would reccamend them to anyone, children and adults alike.",5,"US"
2000-12-01,"The greatest Star Wars story ever!","This is without a doubt the greatest Star Wars adventure ever - this novel not only turned me into a hardcore Star Wars fan, it also launched the reemerging fascination with SW among the general public, a fascination that would reach its height for the release of Episode I.  I would give this book 100000000 stars if I could.There are really no flaws with this book.  Zahn incorporates off-handedly mentioned aspects of SW, such as clones and cloaking shields, and intertwines them with new ideas of his own.  The action is incredibly well-written (probably the best I have ever read) and Zahn captures the spirit of Star Wars wonderfully.  You really can hear John Williams' soundtrack.Of special note are the new characters that, in my mind, might as well be part of the original trilogy.  Mara Jade and Grand Admiral Thrawn are particuarly intriguing characters, though the various smugglers and Niles Ferrier are also some of my favorites.And while the action is well-written, the dialogue scenes are also simply awesome, such as the tension between Thrawn and C'baoth.  This book also has one of the best endings ever.  It is a horrible shame that no other authors were able to capture the spirit and pace of this book.I don't know if I'd like to see this made into a movie, as some reviewers say, but if you read one SW book, this should be it.",5,"US"
2010-09-09,"A masterpiece","I first read this book 15 years ago, and it hasn't lost its magic. While much of the rest of the Star Wars Expanded Universe has become bogged down with irrelevant characters and unrealistic plot twists, Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire Trilogy actually manages to recapture the feeling of the original Star Wars trilogy. The original characters all play great roles and the ploy is well paced. More important, this book introduced several of the Expanded Universe's most beloved characters, from Mara Jade to Grand Admiral Thrawn. I did think Zahn did go a bit overboard with C'baoth at the end. However, Thrawn's ending is easily one of the most dramatic of any in the Expanded Universe. Overall, this trilogy is required reading for any Star Wars fan (the other books - not so much). Too bad there hasn't been anything to match this since the early 1990s.",5,"US"
1998-06-14,"An extremely good book for SW fans or not - action packed","I rarely give out five stars, but this book raelly deserved it. Zahn did an excellent job from begining to end. Loads of action especially during the battle between Skywalker,Mara, and C'baoth.Two of my favorit scenes is when Trrawn sends out his elite forces after Leia and her twins. The other is when Luke and Mara battle the literally insane Jedi Master C'baoth.Lando Calrissian one of the over looked character in the Star Wars books that I've read many has a very impotant part in protecting Leia, as well as the Noghri.I like this part< because it's awesome how Thrawn infiltrates the Rebel base located on Coruscant in the palace of the late emperor Palpatine. I like the battle between Master C'baoth,Luke, and Mara, because it has a lot of action and an interesting plot turn lots of rock falling. There even a Luke vs. Luke battle. The ending is also very uique, some may say it's simple maybe those of you who like big explosions where the enemy could always survive. However Thrawn's end is pretty up close and personal.The only thing I can find possibly bad about this series is that Tommothy Zahn and this series may be slightly over rated but I think it's well desrved.",5,"US"
2003-03-05,"A stunning conclusion to a spectacular trilogy","Timothy Zahn gave it his best when he wrote The Last Command. Out of the entire trilogy, this is by far the best. The book is the longest of the three, but it is by far the fastest read. The storylines are so intense that it would be hard to even consider putting the book down until the last page. In the book, Grand Admiral Thrawn must anticipate the movement of the old republic while confronted with conflict on how to deal with the insane jedi master C'baoth, who has become as tyrannical as the Emperor himself. As this storyline progresses, Luke and Mara also must decide their fate, which could destroy or save the republic.Fear blankets the New Republic under Thrawn's new special weapon. While under this fear, Leia's future jedi children are born, and Mara must attempt to resolve the Emperor's Last Command. All the storylines come together with such perfect emotion, action, and spectacular epic space battles. The Thrawn Trilogy is a good example of what defines the authentic good quality of the Star Wars universe - love, mythology, action, and fantasy. I honestly believe that these three novels are Episodes 7, 8, and 9. If you haven't read the Thrawn trilogy, you are missing out on one of the best science fiction gems of our time.",5,"US"
2008-03-31,"Thrawn Meets his End","In many cases, a reader or viewer of Star Wars can anticipate what will happen in a story before it even starts.  One expects the Rebellion/New Republic to be victorious in the end.  This does not make the plot any less interesting.  One has a vague idea of how the Thrawn Trilogy will end.  Still, it is a quality read.As Thrawn's plan begins to unhatch in ""The Last Command"", his relationship with Dark Jedi clone C'Baoth begins to crumble.  At the same time, the New Republic is pulling allies from sources once thought to be unlikely.  The greatest wild card in the story is Mara Jade.  If you have not read other Star Wars books that chronologically occur after this book, her fate is a mystery.  The author could not have written a more appropriate end to their conflict.  Perhaps this is the biggest curve in the story.As I have expressed in other reviews of Star Wars books, I tend to prefer when the story focuses more on dialogue than on battle scenes.  With the exception of the end, this book does not dwell for extended periods in the tedium of describing battle scenes.  For myself, this made the book a much quicker read.Ranking the Thrawn Trilogy in order of preference, I would suggest the second book is best, while this book is the next best.  By far, I liked the first book in the series the least.  Trends in the reviews seem to follow my opinion to a degree.",5,"US"
2007-04-03,"The Last Command Book Review","The Last Command is the ending book to a Star Wars trilogy. It is set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, and is a science-fiction book. It is about how the Empire, under Grand Admiral Thrawn, starts taking back lost territory at a furious rate and what Luke, Leia, Han Solo, and the New Republic do to stop it. I recommend it for ages eleven through fifteen. You also might want to read Heir to the Empire and Dark Force Rising, the two prequels. I think the audience for this book is ages eleven through fifteen, especially those already acquainted with Star Wars. For example, the book mentions characters portrayed in the movies, and you need to know at least a little of their background, which is mentioned in the movies. The author does not use hugely advanced words, but words like sputter and glide, which are pretty easy to understand. The book contains plenty of information but pieces it together just right, making it easy and informative reading. The novel is only around three-hundred to four-hundred pages long, but you learn a lot. The Last Command is written in an easy to understand way. The writing flows quickly, and it is a real cliff-hanger. I read it in around four days. Young  s will enjoy this book because of the relatively easy vocabulary, speedy reading, and the dramatic writing. I highly recommend it.",5,"US"
1998-08-10,"a horrible book","even though it's the best of Zhan's triology , that's not saying much. Everything in the trilogy ties together in a way that it's unbelivable. Luke  , Leia , Han , Lando , Thrawn and the rest of the gang are always at the right place at the right time. Think about Nkllon , Sluis Van , Honoghr , New Cov (where HAn and Lando found The key to Feyla's plan , ON THE FIRST PLANET THEY VISIT!!) Thrawn is a cool idea that was ruined by Zahn. All he did was bully a few Noghris and smugglers. People say he almost brought down the Republic , where and when did he do that ? He attacked a few shipyards and a few planets , out of millions and millions. I was left with a  tottaly unsatisfied feeling and wondering what's wrong with all the people that like this trilogy. Mara Jade is the typical obnoxious beat up -anyone-in-her-way female that are all over the place now. Karrde is a Thrawn wannabe. and the names Zahn uses are really corny (ie ""Emperor's Hand"" , ""Dark Forc! e""  , etc..) , in short a very bad trilogy that got so famous because it was the first Star Wars novel in the 90's . Read Wolverton's Courtship of Princess Leia and see the kind of style i like.",2,"US"

2003-10-17,"Zahn saved the best for last!","The Last Command is the final book in Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy.  The New Republic has been struck hard by the master warlord Thrawn, but now they face a war on 2 fronts.  Dark Jedi C'Boath, with visions of himself as Emperor, has arisen to challenge Thrawn and seduce Luke Skywalker to his side.  As Leia gives birth to Jedi twins, Han Solo, Lando Calrissian and Luke Skywalker follow Mara Jade, former Emperor's Hand on a quest to destroy Thrawn's cloning facilities.  It is a journey fraught with peril as that will only end when first Mara defeats Skywalker in a dual to the death and stands against C'Boath.  Filled with powerful prose, roaring action sequences, humor and fun, The Last Command is the perfect ending to the Thrawn Trilogy.  It also perfectly sets up these characters for ensuing books, although lesser talents served to make hash out of them.  Enjoyable and eminantely readable, The Last Command is an excellent addition to any fiction collection.",5,"US"
2000-03-22,"Finally, You Care About Zhan's Characters.  A Good Finish!","The Last Command was a good read.  After going through all the highs and lows of this trilogy, the ending was written in classic Star Wars fashion.  Grande Admiral Thrawn who I didn't think too fondly of in this last novel  (I found he was using his hunches too much and found it getting silly, as  opposed to earlier novels where he had a reason to be so calculating, like  artwork examination or personality traits) had a great scene in the end of  the novel.  I loved it and it made the novel for me.Overall after  reading this concluding chapter in Zhan's trilogy I've found I really love  the new characters.  Previously I couldn't have cared less about Mara Jade,  et al.  but Zhan finally does it in this one.  The characters are great.  I  now feel sad about reaching the end and will have to find out what other  novels are out there that use these new characters.",4,"US"
2006-07-12,"A great finale!","""The Last Command"" book 3 of 3 by Timothy Zahn.Grand Admiral Thrawn has somehow managed to start up the ""Cloning"" previously used by the Emperor to restock his troops at a rapid pace and also to Pilot his recently captured fleet. The New republic scrambles to locate the cloning facilities and shut them down permanently. Talon Karrde and Mara Jade become even more firmly planted in the middle of the ongoing struggle between the New Republic and the Old Empire, something both of them originally had no intention of becoming involved in. Jedi Master C'Boath grows restless with Thrawn as he has yet to deliver Leia and Luke as he has promised. Adventure ensues.The Good: The book (Along with the entire series) was very good. This book was a fitting end to the trilogy. Good action, great classic characters and as always the Force.The Bad: Nothing memorableOverall: A great book and series, definitely worth picking up and giving a read.",4,"US"
2003-09-20,"A fitting finale worthy of the ""Star Wars"" name","Timothy Zahn's third and final novel in the Thrawn Trilogy is so faithful to the spirit of George Lucas' original movie trilogy that many fans consider these novels to be Episodes VII, VIII and IX. And if you read this seminal three-book cycle, you'll see why, even though novels published later (such as Shadows of the Empire or Tatooine Ghost) go backwards in the ""Star Wars"" timeline.Here, of course, all the plot threads started in the previous two novels are wrapped up, though some of them will continue to develop in other Star Wars novels. As in the movie series that inspired it, there are space battles and lightsaber duels galore, and the mixture of adventure, romance, and drama that made Star Wars such a popular movie series is vividly recreated in Zahn's crisp and lively writing.",5,"US"
1999-02-22,"This the best Star Wars book ever!","This book is amazing! Timothy Zahn paints vivid pictures of the characters and the different settings in this well-written story. To me, this book seems to come straight from the mind of George Lucas. The characters are  exactly like the ones we remember from the movies with the same  personalities and all. The different settings in the story are beautifully  described in powerful and vivid writing.  The book is easy enough to  follow and flows along very well. However, I found it difficult to pick out  some of the details that make the story completely clear such as, the  discovery of the mysterious "" Delta Source"" (don't worry I'm not  going to give it away!)  I think this is definitely the best book for a  SW fan!",5,"US"
2013-12-05,"Amazing trilogy.  Zahn is magnificent","Wow!  With Palpatine gone you would assume the danger level would be down.  This trilogy was so brilliant on so many levels.  Taking a great military mind and having it mold a Jedi master into evil(a reverse from the movies).  The foreshadowing of Mara as Luke's love interest.  A continuation of Leia into the Republic's burgeoning government.  Just, Thrawn.  The Noghri and their take on Darth Vader.  Opening up doors with the smugglers mentioned.  It was an amazing ride and this conclusion was fully satisfying.",5,"US"
2011-02-19,"One great Star Wars novel!","** SPOILER ALERT **This is the third and last book in the Star Wars The Thrawn Trilogy series.  Grand Admiral Thrawn has the New Republic on the ropes and is close to defeating it.  He is also planning a final attack to shatter the New Republic once and for all with an army of clones and his massive fleet.  Even Luke Skywalker has been cloned and the Grand Admiral has a Jedi of his own.This novel climaxes the Star Wars The Thrawn Trilogy saga with a massive battle and a cliffhanger ending.  I would definitely recommend this book to a Star Wars fan or a Timothy Zahn fan!",5,"US"
2010-08-27,"A Must-Read for Long-time Fans and Newcomers Alike","Zahn was one of the first authors to come up with his own Star Wars plot, back in 1991. He's so great that many Star Wars authors will give him a nod in their ""Acknowledgements"" section. He deserves it.This trilogy is thrilling. If you don't know anything about Star Wars, this is a great place to get started - just watch the original 3 movies and you'll be all right. If you're a well-read Star Wars fan, you must read this book - Zahn created the characters of Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, and Talon Karrde - possibly three of the most interesting characters in the Star Wars cast.The plot is fascinating. Though it's been 5 years since the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of Darth Vader and the Emperor, the New Republic is suddenly put on the defensive when Thrawn gathers what's left of the Empire's resources to subtlety bring down the New Republic. While you have to root for the ""good guys"", you are forced to respect Thrawn because he is such a tactical genius.Zahn also does wonderfully in preserving the essence of all the movie characters - Threepio is still a priss, Han is still an incurably sardonic rogue, Lando is still a diehard businessman with a soft spot, and Luke and Leia are still... Luke and Leia. The writing is very good for this genre, and the books are perfectly paced.Zahn takes you all around the galaxy of Star Wars, showing you just how big it really is. You get to see Chewie's home world of Kashyyyk, meet a new alien race - the Noghri, and discover a lost fleet of two hundred Dreadnaughts. This trilogy reads quickly, is authentic, and has crazy twists. You won't know who to side with - the New Republic or the remnants of the Empire and its Dark Side weapon.",5,"US"
2016-01-03,"Great story","With new movies and new official cannon books these stories might not be as popular. They are still great stories and like the last 30 years will continue to keep Star Wars fans satisfied. At least for me the fact that it won't be several years between official Star Wars only makes me want more. The legends series continues to be quality fiction.",5,"US"
2000-10-13,"Thrawn is at it again....","We all know that good always wins over evil, but we are still constantly fascinated by exactly how it is done.Thrawn is a continued threat to the New Republic, and particularly to Han and Leia's newborn twins. With their Jedi heritage, they could be a valuable tool for the Grand Admiral in the fight against their parents. Leia makes a surprise discovery in the very heart of the New Republic, and Luke has a love-hate relationship with Mara Jade.Thrawn prepares to play his trump card, the existance of a cloning machine which would ensure his victory over the New Republic. Find out who gets cloned and must fight him or herself to the death!",5,"US"
2000-01-10,"A good ending, but not perfect, not by far.","In this novel, most of the things Zahn started in Heir to the empire end up. The novel is much like the other two, it really captures the admosphere and feeling of Star Wars I haven't seen in any other SW novel until sofar  (including Zahn's newest two SW novels). In general, I thought it was a  great book, a must read for any Star Wars fan. Unfortunally, the ending of  the whole story isn't really impressive, the way Thrawn got killed simply  sucked while that lane C'baot character got  a dying scene better than that  of the Emperor's! I mean, if a great villain like Thrawn really had to die,  why like that? Next to that, the Imperials in this novel had that classic  James bondisch ""evil organisation with lots of minios"" flaw, once  the great big, mean evil villian is gone, they run out of cannon fodder.  But credit where credit's due, again, Zahn delivered a true SW masterpiece,  .",4,"US"
1998-02-06,"Please, DO write some more STAR WARS books for us, Mr. Zahn!","This trilogy definitely is by far the absolute best stuff I've ever read in my life!Not one of the other STAR WARS authors did manage to write a story so thrilling and true to the characters of the original as Mr. Zahn did. Perhaps even more so. I must admit that he's a genius. And I'm not a person to say so very often.Till now I've read about seventeen English STAR WARS books, but after reading this trilogy (I'm reading the books in chronological order), I didn't really believe that someday I would happen to find a better book lying in my hands.Actually, I never did.May the force be with you, DANA (Germany)",5,"US"
1999-10-06,"Perfect just Perfect!!","This book is wonderful and think what will the comic be like Whoah! I would love to see this books' triolgy be made into movies it's great. But first they have to make the Courtship of Princess Leai first now that book  is great. It would make the perfect finish to the last three, give you an  idea of what happened next. Mara Jade this girl kinda gave me a headache I  mean was she good or bad or what?? Winter is good too. But my favorit  person was Leai I have all her lines in the book and the movie memoized. So  if George Lucus gets board one day. All he hasta do is make these into  movies. Get the book you'll love it garnented.",5,"US"
2003-03-17,"I have read this book 5 times","And each time it gets better and better. This is, without a doubt, my favorite fictional book. E.V.E.R. There is some deeper sense that always gets me to return to this book. It is well written, and like I said to the first book in the series, does not borrow heavily on the films and when it does, in a good way. The ending, while somewhat predictable was also somewhat of a major plot twist that had your jaw drop to the floor as Mara Jade, the Emperor's top private assassin trained to use the Force and her final mission given to her by the Emperor to kill Skywalker, confronts Luuke Skywaler in a duel to the death.",5,"US"
1997-08-14,"The author of this book knew what he was doing.","So many times you'll find a book about a certain series and it just doesn't fit with what everyone else wrote.Not this one. It fits perfectly with everything that had been writen before it.He explains everything very well and puts it all together with great style. He spends enough time with each of the characters so you know what's going on but not to much so you know exactly what's going to happen.The climax at the end of it was truly worth the Star Wars name. Well done Mr. Zahn!! My favorite part of the book was the last chapter although I think he should have gone a little farther",5,"US"
2016-06-07,"Classic","Once again, I'm amazed at how much the SW authors can pack into one book and somehow make it all work.I very much enjoyed the character interactions in this book, but it was the little touches throughout that really made it stand out.",5,"US"
1999-07-12,"An awsome book","I have always been a fan of starwars.  I loved the other two books in the series (heir to the empire, dark force rising), but when I read the final conclusion, I thought that it was the best book that I had ever read. There were many new characters, like Grand Admiral Thrawn, Captain Pellaon, Talon  Karrade, Joruus C'baoth and Mara Jade, that were fascinating. I felt like I  was there in that last battle against C'baoth.  It was very fitting when  Mara killed Luuke and C'baoth.  What a great way to end the story.  It is  a book that I recomend every star wars fan should read.",5,"US"
1997-11-21,"A great book which really captures the feel of Star Wars","I can't say anything about hearing a John Williams score in the background, but I can say that it is, in all probability, better than the original trilogy that started it all (no offence meant, George). It's atmosphere is very imaginable the way it is presented, and still somehow leaves enough out the first few times, that you can pick it up in subsequent readings. The first two books in the trilogy can fill in some details, also, to give you a more complete picture. Zahn's projection of technology also gives you things to think about, even when you have long since finished.",5,"US"
1998-07-07,"THE BEST!!!","I read this about two years ago, and I admit, I don't remember all of it.  But I can tell you that it was AWESOME!  Timothy Zahn is a master at portraying lively characters - you get to know each character very personally, which you rarely find in books.  Yeah, true, Thrawn was probably the favorite for most people who have read the book, but you can't deny that Mara was the bomb!  I have been immensely disappointed after reading many of the other Star Wars books afterwards (Jedi Academy seemed like a children's book compared to this), so Zahn - please write more!",5,"US"
1999-02-12,"Best book I have ever read....! Excellent work...!","I will make this short and sweet.Get this book and all of Mr. Timothy Zahns Star Wars novels. If you call yourself a true SW person, you must read these books. You will be so glad you did.A reader from Honolulu,  Hawaii , February 10,  where it was Luke vs Luuke, and the only problem  was, how did Joruus get the Force bacK from the ysalamari!Joruus had  his private Stormtroopers plant bombs on them and had them killed when he  pressed the trigger. (Reread that part in the book).Well done Mr. Zahn,  don't ever Stop writting SW novels...!!!!",5,"US"
1999-12-04,"Zahn...why anyone else?","Having read all 5 Zahn books, I felt obligated to write a review for my favorite of them all. I truly can't understand why anyone else writes Star Wars books. Well, I can understand it, I just wish they didn't have to!  After his 5, I find the characters he created: Karrde, Jade, Thrawn, and  Tierce and Flim in the new ones. He delves so deep into the roguish realm  of SW that it gives readers a new perspective, while at the same time  convincing us that the good guys are vulnerable. Nothing peeves me more  than unstoppable heroes.  My only real qualm: I actually want the bad guys  to win. Come on, who really didn't want Thrawn to take over at least part  of the galaxy, hmm?",5,"US"
2003-06-02,"Exciting Conclusion to a great trilogy!","This is the last book in the trilogy (I should hope so, 'cause it's no. 3) And nothing to be scoffed at. Exciting doings occur and the conclusion offers many suprise outcomes. I'll give you one hint: Look closely at the cover. Luke has a BLUE lightsaber. That *hint* *hint* may or may not have something to do with one of them. The Noghri are an interesting group, and Leia provides them with insight as to why the New Republic is superior to the empire. This is a story that is indeed worthy enough to have the phrase Star Wars on the cover. I highly approve of this book for readers everywhere.",5,"US"
2015-04-12,"First time read of Star Wars Novels.","I was curious after getting the Star Wars Chronology book. The movies only capture a real small period of events in the Star Wars universe. This trilogy helped explain that the Empire was still a powerful force for several years to come. I am not much of a regular reader but this will make me read more of the author's Star Wars novels.",5,"US"
1999-10-16,"Great ending to great trilogy!","This book had great action and a great plot!  Like the first two books the author had retained the character's personality and the Star Wars Spirit.  When I read the book, I loved how the book reminded me of Return of the  Jedi. How I can't say because it will spoil the book for others.  I loved  how the bad guys were defeated once and as how this is truly Star Wars. I  love this book and I love Star Wars.  I encourage anyone who want a good  action Star Wars story to get this Star Wars Trilogy. May the Force be with  you.",5,"US"
2001-05-31,"Third Installment Not to Bad","Timothy Zahns Star Wars: The Last Command is the concluding novel in the three part series put out by Zahn. The novel takes all of the unfinished business from the two previous novels and puts them back together. In the previous novels the reader is presented with intriguing facts about Thrawn and his plot to crush the Alliance. Here the novel once again plunges reader back into the story, picking up where it left off. The Alliance, already crippled by Thrawns attacks, attempts one more effort to take down the Empires cloning facility and once again bring peace to the galaxy. The mission, already complicated, is made even more by factoring in the Dark Jedi C`boath and his cloned Jedi. However, the Alliance is not down and out, an unknown ally will come from the darkness.  Overall the book was enjoyable. The storyline is powerful enough to keep readers reading on to find out what happens. The characters are wonderfully depicted throughout the novel letting readers see deeper into the familiar and unfamiliar characters of the Star Wars Universe. Even with a couple laughable characters, the book is well written with respect to the original Star Wars, mixing in political intrigue, a good science fiction background and the somewhat nerdy Force.",4,"US"
2005-02-01,"Great ending to a so-so trilogy","I was pleasingly surprised by Zahn's ability as a writer.  The first book I thought was horribly written.  The second was much better, but still lacked something.  This third is by far the best of the 3.  I am glad I waded through 'Heir to the Empire' in order to get to this book.The plot is insightful and cunning; the characters become more animated and believable; his descriptions of scenery is far better.  Zahn gave this third book the story line and subplots deserving of the Star Wars name.",5,"US"
2000-04-30,"Great ending to a Great Trilogy","The Last Command is by far the best of Timothy Zahn's Star Wars trilogy, and the best of all Star Wars books.  As I read this, I could so easily picture this book as if it were another Episode in the Star Wars movies,  and could almost hear the unforgettable music from Star Wars.  Unlike other  Star Wars books, the plot is nice and simple; good vs. evil, exactly like  the movies.  What drew me to the Star Wars movies was the mythological  aspect, and The Last Command conveys this almost better than the movies.",4,"US"
1998-12-09,"Excellent characterization and beautiful plotting","The Thrawn trilogy were the first SW novels I read and so far, the best.  Zahn not only managed to breathe new life into all the characters from the movies, he gave them a plausible villian and a plausible threat.  Thrawn is  easily the best-worked villian in the entire SW universe, and the only one  who truly manages to portray the Empire as something other than evil.  In  his actions, he shows the desire for order, which is a historically  plausible reason for imperialism.  A beautiful book.",5,"US"
2013-12-06,"Best of the three","My favorite book of the trilogy.It was amazing to ""see"" (read) the Solo twins for the first time, though kind of sad considering what happens later on. The ending duel between Luke and his clone was very creepy ... reminded me of the dark side cave duel on Dagobah. Surprised that Mara killing the clone fulfilled the Emperor's command to her, but it does make sense; they were identical, after all. Thrawn was a cool villian, but I was not sorry to see him offed. Rukh certainly redeemed himself in killing Thrawn.",5,"US"
1999-08-13,"An enrapturing tour de force","Its interesting to note that so many readers enjoyed seeing Luke (a fully fledged Jedi Knight) come across as a bit of a wuss compared to the towering Mara Jade who more or less ends up saving the day.  So why then do  people want the pair to get together?  Surely the illustrious Jade would be  far better off with someone with more balls and charisma; someone like  Lando Calrissian!  Just kidding folks.  Do enjoy, what in my opinion (for  what it's worth), is a magnum opus.",5,"US"
2008-08-17,"Decent Ending To A Decent Series","I must say that this Thrawn trilogy was quite an enjoyable read. Not a 5 star read but definitely a 4 star.This final book in the trilogy is not without it's merits and kept my interest for the most part. Overall, however, I had a hard time getting captivated, not because the story was uninteresting, just the writing style was a little plain at times.Overall, I definitely recommend this book and the trilogy to all Star Wars fans.",4,"US"
1999-03-07,"THE GRIPPING CONCLUSION TO THE #1 BEST-SELLING SAGA!","The Empire, now under the command of Grand Admiral Thrawn, is producing cloned enemy fighters from an unknown origin. On Coruscant, the heart of the Rebellion, Leia Organa Solo is fighting an unseen enemy: Delta Source,  a secret listening system developed by the Empire. Meanwhile, Luke  Skywalker has traveled to the city Calius, in hope of finding the source or  any information leading to the cloning that is threatening the very  survival of the Rebellion. On Corusscant, Leia finds a new source of  informatmion that is very helpful, but her luck does not hold out. The  Empire attacks Coruscant, releasing cloaked man-made asteroids into  Coruscant's atmosphere. Luke Skywalker, Lando Calrissian, Han Solo,  Chewbacca, Mara Jade, C-3PO, and R2-D2, set out to Wayland, the location of  the cloning fortress, to destroy it. As the story continures, the four  humans, one Wookie, and two droids find dangers at every corner. As the  team continure their search on Wayland, they finally find the cloning  wharehouse. They eneter without any problems, only to find the cloned Jedi  Master C'baoth waiting for them! As the two Jedi, mara and Luke, find  themselves fighting the insane Jedi Master, the rest of the team are trying  to find a way to destroy the fortress before it's too late.",5,"US"
1999-07-11,"Good, but lacking in some areas","A decent conclusion to the Zahn trilogy.  A few problems with it though: I found the fact that Fey'lya was still on the new republic counsel after what he did in the last book ridiculous.  Also, the ending battles, both in  space and in the throne room had some flaws.  The smugglers part in the  space battle made little sense.  As well, Mara destroying both of the  enemies in the throne room was also disappointing.  Overall, the trilogy  was decent reading, but it did not feel like star wars.",3,"US"
2000-07-16,"Thrawn Trilogy","The entire Thrawn Trilogy was one of the best Star Wars books since George Lucas wrote A New Hope. A exiting edition to the Star Wars trilogy, introducing a whole hoarde of new characters, along with our favoite old  ones. Most important of all Zahn adds one of the five greatest Imperial  leaders to this trilogy, The man who it was named for, Grand Admiral  Thrawn. Thrawn joins five other Imperial leaders, The Emperor, Darth Vader,  Moff Tarkin, and Admiral Daala. Among them he is the most tactically  brilliant of all. He studies a species art to discern physcological  blindspots and then tailors his attacks against them.His downfall was his  trust in his subordinates, normally a hero trait. I actually found myself  crying in his death scene. In fact, I have recently been bothering some  people at Lucasfilm to see if Thrawn will appear in the Prequels.  Unfortunately, This novel happens to detract from the image of Star Wars.  In the movies it is simply good verses evil. In this novel, The Evil is a  lot harder to dicern. I mean Thrawn is not really Evil, is he? I thought he  deserved to defeat the new repub-, I mean the Rebellion. All in all an  excellent trilogy, and The Hand of Thrawn duolgy is even better. A  must-read",5,"US"
1998-11-02,"One of the best!","This has got to be one of the best Star Wars books ever written, and it is in the best series as well. Timothy Zahn has given us a superb book with an involving storyline, interesting new characters, new species, new planets,  and they all come together in this amazing end to the trilogy. Zahn manages  to portray the characters much more accurately than many of the other Star  Wars authors around. This book is a must buy if you liked the first two in  the series.",5,"US"
2015-05-20,"It all comes to an end.","The slow build finally comes to a climax! The pacing of the Thrawn Trilogy lends itself well to offering lots of different stories and angles from several perspectives across the three books. The story wraps up nicely, although somewhat quickly once you get there. You really get a sense of full appreciation for all characters involved, with the lighthearted hopefulness you would expect with a Star Wars ending.",4,"US"
2013-07-11,"AMAZING!!!!!","This is the epic conclusion to the thrawn Trilogy. The ending battle was epic. This book reminded me of ROTJ with out the Ewoks! If you have read the previous installments in this trilogy, you wont be disappointed. With this installment into the Star Wars EU, Timothy Zahn set him self as the best Star Wars novel writer. This is a must read. I also recommend the audio book!",5,"US"

2007-05-01,"The Best Way to Experience This Book","I want to highly recommend you get the audio versions of this trilogy which is amazing.  As great as the books are (and if you've read them you know they are probably the most worthy of the title ""Star Wars"" of any book written in the entire star wars universe), now imagine hearing them dramatically performed complete with (and this is the best part) John Williams original soundtrack set to the events of these books.  If you've read the books, try this out, you will enjoy it.  If you've heard the book, go back and read it because the audio version is abridged.  Hope you enjoy it.  I know I did.",5,"US"

2000-08-28,"The explosive final","In this last book of the Zahn-trilogy the carefully built plots come to an  explosive finale. And that in a Star Wars worthy manner. Especially towards  the end you can really see the parallels to the final battle to Return of  the Jedi and still you get something totally new and very exciting.  The  way Zahn answers all the open questions is fabulous and sometimes you just  want to say ""Ahhh... I should have realized"". And during all the  action Zahn does't forget to concentrate on the really important thing':  the characters who have to go threw a lot of fighting, political intrigue,  personal angers and fears until it all is over. The best Star Wars books  ever com to a conclusion and in the end you just want to start reading  again, like it was with the movies.",5,"US"
2018-06-05,"Wow!","The Wookie speaking basic is a little rough but a great laugh. This is like listening to a movie with full sound effects and great narration.",5,"US"
2005-04-19,"Well done but somewhat ""clunky""","The climax to this series is not as good as the previous two books.  However, COMMAND is still a great read.  The main problem I have with it is that Mara Jade seems to gain a lot of control over the force in a very short time.  The clone of Luke is a bit....well....silly.  How did Luke's hand get found by the villian?  The characters are dead on though.  I enjoyed the series a lot, but this book was a bit of a let down.  It seemed a bit rushed.  Zahn tied all his plot threads together very quickly.  The novel is worth reading, but without the entire series it would be just an average story at best.",4,"US"
1999-01-17,"Amazing conclusion","I wasn't too impressed with this book when I first started reading it. ( It had been a while since I read the previous 2 in the series ). However, despite the slightly slow start, the last one third of the book moves at a  lightning pace. The demise of Thrawn - it almost brings a tear to the eye.  The character of Thrawn tends to grow on you...  depicted as an  intellectual of the first order.",5,"US"
2015-03-13,"Great Way to End the Series","The three Thrawn books are great, fast-paced stories that uphold the spirit of the original Star Wars movies. The Last Command is the best book of the Series. It leads to a final battle that evokes the same thrill that seeing Luke and Vader battling in front of the Emperor did.",5,"US"
2014-11-30,"The Last Command Student Review","Zahn does a wonderful job of conveying the Star Wars ""feel"" to his audience, from the interplanetary space battles, to the so well described ground armadas and their wars you truly think you are apart of the Galaxy Far Far Away and you're left wanting more at the turn of every page. The relationships that are established both internally and externally offer a rich, immersed delve into the text that you can always relate to. It's these relationships that further enhance the lore that is already exemplary. Great all around read to finish off this trilogy.",5,"US"

2009-08-12,"Great Ending to a Top-Quality Story","Greatest trilogy next to the original saga I've ever read. For that matter, this has to this day been the best story I've ever read and is what really got me into reading books. The story throughout all three books was so well written and had me so entranced I can't honestly pick a favorite. If Hollywood really needs some help making a decent movie again, I would love to see this story on screen.",5,"US"
2009-04-29,"conclusion to a great series","What can i say that other reviewers havent if you like starwars you owe it to yourself to pick these three books up i read them one after another and couldnt put them down other authors doing starwars novels take note,thrawn is a well thought out villan and zahn doesnt insult his readers by delivering a worthy ending to his space opera highly recommend",5,"US"
2000-06-19,"If you haven't read this trilogy, you're a fool.","Timothy Zahn has proven himself to be the best Star Wars novelist since Lucas himself with this series. He is a masterful author, or he is with this group, at least. His writing is of the style that feeds your  imagination just what it needs to produce a complete image of what's going  on at all times, but not so much as to take the fun out of imagining. The  storyline in this trilogy fits perfectly into the Star Wars universe. If  you're a Star Wars fan and you haven't read these (or any novels) then  you're just not a fan. If you've read novels but skipped this, then you're  a fool!",5,"US"

2000-05-18,"Thrawn trilogy","Outstanding, I am a new fan of Timothy Zahn's Star Wars saga and I am now hooked. The story line was easy to listen to and its characters very consistent with that of George Lucas editions. The plot was innovative and  left you in suspense. I encourage any new fan to hear this and follow this  trilogy with the audio book edition  of The Hand of thrawn (2 Volumes).  These include Spectre of the Past and Vision of the Future. The audio  edition is very descriptive and takes your imagination through the force  and within the battle itself, with sounds of special effects and alien life  forms.Once you start to hear the story unravel you are hooked and yearning  for more, it is an addictive story and a must read for star wars fan old  and new. Good luck and may the force be with you,,,,,,,,,,,,",4,"US"
2000-07-13,"Better than the other two","The Last Command is the best of the trilogy.  It's got more adventure and wierd stuff.  They should have focused more on the final lightsaber battle though.  The final spacebattle over those shipyards was pretty short, in  fact I don't remember it being described at all (except for a few  sentances).  The Last Command is the best of the three books, but don't  read it until you've read the first two.",4,"US"
2016-04-01,"Three Stars","Could only give three stars.  Found the plot to drag.  Still a worthwhile read.",3,"US"
1999-02-23,"Bravo!!","This book is the perfect example of the great potential authors of today have to capture the flavor and rythym of STAR WARS. Zahn introduced new characters with such charisma and style that I found myself begging for an  encore. This is by far the best trilogy I have ever read, and this book was  the crowning achievement.",5,"US"
1999-08-07,"GREAT, Of of those 'Stay-Up-Till-3-in-the-morning-reading-it","It's really good. I suggest anyone really interested in Star Wars should read this. If you're not interested don't read it, because then all you'lee be able to do is write a review to Amazon.com and say that it sucked, but  not you really like Star Wars anyway. That's just stupid!READ THE BOOK,  IT ROCKS!!!!!",5,"US"
2000-07-14,"Excellent, grabs you and doesn't let go!","The final book in the Thrawn Trilogy doesn't disappoint fans. Zahn is an excellent writer, and does justice to the characters we've seen before, and gives us a wide variety of new characters to meet and explore. Once into  this book, I wasn't able to stop reading! It's a sure-fire hit with any  Star Wars fan.",5,"US"
1997-10-01,"Extensively Overwhelming Conclusion is a Hit","This book is simply a masterpiece, although,  if you read it directly after HEIR, you might notice that HEIR is more likeable in a way that it is more like the movie trilogy. Zahn has  marvelously captured the flavor of STAR WARS,  although a slot weaker than HEIR in some aspects. ZAHN'S TRILOGY RULES!",5,"US"
2016-03-13,"See ya Thrawn!","It's a good trilogy. Each book is good in their own right, but all in all a good trilogy. Kind of fills in the gaps.",4,"US"
2014-01-28,"Zahn rocks! 'Nuff said","I was sad to see this fantastic trilogy end. I love the new characters of Karrde, Mara Jade and especially Thrawn. What an awesome bad dude that I loved to hate! Add in Han, Leia, Chewie and the droids not to mention my very perfect Jedi, Luke Skywalker and you have a veritable masterpiece. A must read.",5,"US"
2005-02-26,"Zahn is brilliant, but I just didn't like that much.","Timothy Zahn is one of my favorite writers, and this is the only Star Wars related material I've ever read. I really liked how he used the characters and made them seem like they were carrying on right after the old movies.But the ending seemed kind of well, boring. If you haven't read it I'm not necessarily going to give it away but It was just anti-climatic. Also, why is Mara Jade learns and grows just as much in the force as Luke does in 4 days in the jungle as Luke does throughout his whole life. The clone thing at the end was kind of dumb, but overall it was a good book and a good triology. The only Star Wars material I'm ever going to read.",4,"US"
2000-06-11,"A good read, as well as a ""antique"" of the Expanded Universe","An exellent read, despite a clone heavy plot. Zahn's solution to Mara's problem is quite clever indeed, and the Noghri are an interesting species indeed. (One misused in my opinion by Salvatore) The good guys succede,  Leia has her children. Bravo, and what an Encore that has followed:).",4,"US"
2002-06-01,"A great conclusion","The conclusion to the trilogy, this book was packed with lots of action.  The climactic battle at the end was exciting and had an interesting surprise.  I loved all three of these books.  The new characters and storylines they introduced lay the foundations for many more great Star Wars novels.",5,"US"
1998-08-23,"Fantastic","I have read a lot of Starwars books in my time this has to be the best  yet.Zahn has outdone himeself this time.I belive the detail and the  characters turned out beutifully.His words seem to flow like water from the  pages.It was hard to put down.Keep up the good work Zahn!",5,"US"
2016-01-07,"Three Stars","An able conclusion to an entertaining series.",3,"US"
2001-10-21,"This trilogy sets the standard!","Heir to the Empire, Dark force Rising, The Last CommandThe Good:The idea of a grand admiral in control of the emperor's legacy is brilliant.An insane dark jedi, clone soldiers, a coalition of smugglers, jedi twins and on and on goes Mr Zahn.Adventure, ha, Excitement, ha, a reader cares about these things!!The Bad:Absolutely noting.Conclusion:This trilogy sets the standard for all other writers. It is that good! Thank you Mr. Zahn",5,"US"
1998-06-06,"What can I say?","This is one of the best books I have read in my entire life. I read it for the first time in '95 and have reread it time and again. The characterization, plot, action........ hell, everything about this book made it great. Zahn is truly a master of his art, an auhtor without peer. I wish I'd had the chance to read it much earlier, unfortunately I wasn't able to but when I finally did I was basically speechless. Zahn has a style that really gets the reader into the book, so much so that you don't want to put it down. I'm an aspiring writer, and all I can say is that I would love to be compared to him (even if I recieve a bad review).",5,"US"
1997-05-06,"The Beginning","Timothy Zahn has, with this series, inspired a flood of Star Wars books that we enjoy today.  Never before have I been so entranced by a Star Wars novel, and I hape to read more about Our dear friend Admiral Thrawn.  After all, there's allways the Hand",5,"US"
1999-06-23,"This is a Fast paced conclusion to the trilogy.","This book concludes the trilogy in a fast paced, exciting way, having the 'final showdown' in Mount Tantiss between Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade. I am currently 3/4 way through and am enjoying it a lot!  A thoroughly  deserved winner of *****'s!!",5,"US"
2014-12-14,"gift","Bought for grandson as gift .can't rate as I don't read these. He seems to like them",5,"US"
2013-07-26,"The Last Command Review","This book is the perfect conclusion to the Thrawn trilogy. This is one of the best written Star Wars books, and a must read for any Star Wars fan.",5,"US"
1997-11-04,"Really awesome","This book is the best Star Wars book ever! Because, ""It was so artistically done."" As well,  C'baoth is a ""mindless philosipher"" and truly insane. In short, the book, for heroes and villains, is ""725 to 1""!",5,"US"
1999-08-07,"Great ending to the Thrawn Trilogy!","Zahn saved the best for last with his final book of the Thrawn trilogy.  This book was great, I read the last 180+ pages in one day because I was hooked!  I rated the first two books 4 out of 5 but this one is definitely  a 5.",5,"US"
2001-01-23,"Very disappointing","Zahn's writing style is terrible and made me abandon reading this series.  I read 'Heir to the Empire' and listened to 'Dark Forces Rising' and 'The Last Command' on audio cassette because I wanted to know what happened but I didn't want the pain of reading the second two parts of the trilogy.The ysalamiri are ridiculous - a sort of kryptonite for the Jedi - as is C'Boath the dark Jedi Master.  How come we hadn't heard of these before - they would have been pretty difficult to keep secret.  And the way Thrawn can anticipate any bluff or double bluff and never be wrong makes him unbelievable as well.  Mara Jade is a good character though.I suggest people read the X-Wing series first which is much better or even 'The Truce at Bakura' which is well written.",2,"US"
2007-09-02,"Not Free SF Reader","""Just when the Republic thought that the insidious and unfortunatelyvery clever Thrawn could sink no lower, he does. In other words, sendin the clones!This gives him the manpower (clonepower?) he needs to crew enoughships to blow the guts out of lots of the Republic forces andfortresses.Han and Chewie must gain aid from a smuggler fleet, to try and stop Thrawn. Luke contends with the evil Jedi Master C'Boath.Leia, very heavily pregnant, desperately tries to hold things together politically.",3,"US"
2011-11-13,"Thumbs up!","I love how the ending went with this book. The collection really is a gem considering how one story is connected with one another and how the characters come alive as you read and enjoy the book.",5,"US"
2015-01-28,"Very good Star Wars sequel","Very good ending to the trilogy.  Well-written.",4,"US"
2000-01-26,"Zahn:  Greatest Star Wars Author","This book is quite possibly the best book ever written.  It concludes the trilogy in true Star Wars fashion.  I couldn't put the book down, it is fast-paced and non-stop.  A great book.  If you feel that some questions are left unanswered (Luke and Mara, what Fey'la is so concerned with the  New Republic finding) then read Zahn's ""Spector of the Past"" and  ""Vision of the Future""  They will answer any questions you have.  All in all, Zahn is the greatest Star Wars author ever.",5,"US"
1999-02-18,"Required Reading for any Star Wars Fan","Zahn is a master at how he weaves wonderful new experiences into the lives of the characters that we know and love.  The trilogy that this book is part of is a sci-fi masterpiece and serves as a great example of how Star  Wars novels should be written! Bravo!  Mara Jade was a brilliant idea and  she is not a run of the mill character, but rather a complicated enigma  that is sure to live on in many novels to come!",5,"US"
1998-04-16,"An excellent work","This was an excellent book, in turn part of an excellent trilogy. As with many others I was saddened to see the brilliant military genius of Grand Admiral Thrawn die in the end but I thought that Zahn made his death as graceful as his life. The other character I have to compliment Zahn on is Captain Pellaeon who captures the essence of an Imperial officer perfectly, to the point where even the greatest supporters of the rebels can sympathise with him.  An excellent book that gives even greater depth to the Star Wars universe.....",5,"US"
2003-02-07,"Awesome ending to the Thrawn trilogy","THIS BOOK IS KILLER!!So much going on...clones, Dreadnaughts, Mara and Luke's conflicts, Jorus C'baoth, and the dreaded genius Admiral Thrawn.Excellent performance by the Noghri.I could read this book over and over.",5,"US"
2000-08-18,"This was my fav of the Trilogy","I liked this one the best. Mara Jade has to be one of the coolest Star  Wars characters (I'm SO glad she and Luke are getting married!!). In my  opinion she is the star of this book.",5,"US"
2006-03-17,"Thrawn Finale","A great finish to the trilogy.  I wish all Star Wars books reached this standard of drama and action.  I will admit though that the ending felt rushed, especially the part with Luke (and Luuke).Overall, this is a Star Wars series you can't miss if you are at all interested in the Expanded Universe.",5,"US"
1998-02-13,"You can learn alot from art...","Grand Admiral Thrawn was the most emotional and ""Human"" of all Imperial Leaders. He made the trilogy what it is, and spectors of him will surface again...",5,"US"
2018-09-06,"Great Book in the Series","Fantastic",5,"US"
1998-08-01,"Zahn did a Great Job of Portraying all of Our Old Friends","This was a great book. The characters that we are all familiar with , and ones that he made up, were so real, so alive. I would spend hours arguing with Han and Leia, or fighting alongside Luke, his lightsaber glowing, or twittering alongside R2-D2 when he unearthed yet again valuable information. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to keep the Star War tradition alive.",5,"US"
2013-11-10,"Awesome","I couldn't put the Thrawn series down.  Great continuation of the story.  Preserved the characteristics of the players in the story.",5,"US"

1999-08-04,"Simply superb!","I have read the tree books of THRAWN WARS from Timoty Zahn, this books are simply superb, they keep the pure style of STARWARS TRILOGY and currenty Episode I, it will be a shame if George Lucas won't  take them to the  movies, i have that concern,(perhaps in 10 years, who knows)the writing is  very descriptive,so you can have very fine details. ENJOY THEM!",5,"US"
1999-06-04,"Horrible book (trilogy)","I REALLY hope this is not the story that they will film as the ""what-happend-after-Return-Of-The-Jedi"". Because they will ruin EVERYTHING. Nice sympathy points for  ""let's-rememberaized-what-happened/the  characters-in-the-Star-Wars-Trilogy"". To me Mara Jade, Thrawn, Talon  Karde don't even exist on Star Wars.",1,"US"

2000-05-07,"From a tiny outpost on the rim...","This was the best ""Star Wars"" book, which capped off the best ""Star Wars"" trilogy ever written.  Timothy Zahn is the best ""Star Wars"" author.

2006-01-15,"Zahn Rushes Through Last Book of Trilogy","The Last Command is a novel that you will find hard to put down. Zahn's genius is most present up to the last chapters of the book.The last chapters of the book appered to be rushed, and this reader was asking How? Why? I think that Zahn was in a hurry to get the book to print.The Last Command deserved a better conclusion.",4,"US"

1999-03-23,"What a GREAT Book","This is the best book I have ever read.  The super climatic end to the perfect series.  I especially love the introduction of Mara Jade into the star wars world. I also became very attatched to Grand Admiral Thrawn, and  the way he died was a great ending.",5,"US"

The book is action packed from cover to cover, and concludes his Star Wars book trilogy in epic fashion.  Zahn provides the New Republic (formerly the Rebellion) with a stern challenge in the form of Grand Admiral Thrawn, a military genius, and Joruus C'baoth, an insane Jedi Master.  There are several interesting sub-plots in this book and in Zahn's trilogy, these contribute greatly to the overall plot of the story.  I didn't think a book, could match the magic of the Star Wars movies, I was wrong",5,"US"

For me, the best part was the character development, especially in Karrde and Mara.  This was the best of the three books to me, mostly because of the climax.  It was thrilling and deeply emotional.
