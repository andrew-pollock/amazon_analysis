2018-08-05,"Dated by the prequels, but still better than Disney's films","I re-read this trilogy after becoming disillusioned with the Disney sequel trilogy.  I enjoyed this MUCH more.  I know there was a lot of ""Expanded Universe"" (now Legends) crap being published, but the Thrawn Trilogy was not among it.You could tell it was written prior to the release of the Prequel trilogy because of terms like ""Dark Jedi"" instead of ""Sith"" and other things that don't quite fit with those films.  However, it's very easy to read past those inconsistencies and enjoy this trilogy.  I really wish Disney had re-worked these books into their trilogy so that events herein take place 30 years after Return of the Jedi rather than the 5 years in this book.  It would have been MUCH more enjoyable.",5,"US"
2017-08-25,"Best Star Wars author best series in the fanverse","Timothy Zahn Star Wars books are the best and Thrawn is a great villain. The detail about the force abilities and thinking that goes behind Luke's choices is done very well. I never thought I'd like a Star Wars fan fiction book until I read this series. If you are a fan I highly recommend it as will anyone else who has ever read any Star Wars books. It's obviously good enough that Disney even added Thrawn to the official Star Wars universe as he is in the show 'Star Wars: Rebels.' I'm sure many would agree all the Thrawn books, would have made for great movies, but still they are great on their own no matter what the movies do with the characters",5,"US"
2016-09-26,"The story flows seamlessly from one scene to the next as the action progresses culminating - much like Return of the Jedi - with","The final installment of the Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy has everything anyone reading the first two novels in this series could have wanted.  The story picks up approximately a month after the events of Dark Force Rising as the Empire begins to press the advantage they won at the end of the last novel.  Once again, Zahn's writing shines as he uses such vivid detail that it is almost impossible not to visualize the story as if you were watching it on a screen.  The story flows seamlessly from one scene to the next as the action progresses culminating - much like Return of the Jedi - with a space battle, a ground battle and a force battle at once, ensuring a gripping finale to an outstanding series.",5,"US"
2017-07-20,"A trilogy from a true master of words!","Timothy Zahn is a mastermind of science fiction.  As an author his brilliance is on par with Poul Anderson and the like. This series is an amazing continuation of the Star Wars universe. Especially considering he does so much to build characters, create new worlds and all while staying in line with the amazing alternate universe that is the Star Wars universe.A must read, it will fill in gaps and create new and better possibilities.",5,"US"
2017-12-16,"Star Wars: The Last Novel","This is it; the last Star Wars novel worth reading.  Even though this novel is long, drawn out, and sometimes hard to follow - this book is still so much better than all the new “canon” books, and the other “Legends” books.  In this Thrawn series, the author took risks, had original new ideas, and actually did something with the characters.  You will never see another Star Wars novel like these Thrawn books.  All the new novels do is just play it safe; never advancing any serious Star Wars stories.  Bravo, Timothy Zahn!",4,"US"
2012-10-01,"A Thrilling Conclusion!","The Last Command is the third book of the Trawn trilogy, which takes place a few years after ""Return of the Jedi"". In this final installment of the series, full-scale war has reignited in multiple sectors acoss the galaxy, and the Empire is regaining control of planets necessary for reestablishing system dominance. The brilliant part about this final book is we get to see Grand Admiral Thrawn demonstrate his full tactical genius in combat as the Empires chief of command. Not only has be managed to make massive restorations to the empires fleet through expert covert operations resolved at the end of  the second book, ""Dark Force Rising"", he is also able to utilize his gains with surgical precision and efficiency. My favorite part is that Thrawn establishes himself as a villain that you come to respect and believe in! Not only is he clever and effective he is also respectful to his crew and subordinates. One may argue that this is because the insane Jedi Master C'baoth is seeking to gain supremacy over the Empire and establish himself as the new emperor. Thrawn is placed in a difficult position of having to guarantee the loyalty of his soldiers by maintaining troop morale, and establishing mutual respect while C'boath uses his dark powers of manipulation in an attempt to subvert Thrawn's hard-earned authority. This is, by far the most complex and compelling villain dynamic I have yet seen in a star wars storyline!The situation with the rebels is also brilliantly executed. Mara Jade must carefully navigate her shifting allegiances as she struggles with her own challenges both internally and with her continually shifting circumstances. She must find a way to resolve the awful spell that palatine beset upon her, compelling her to kill Luke Skywalker in vengeance. She also doesn't exactly like Luke, because the death of the emperor terminated her previous position as hand to the empire, which was considerably lucrative. All of this occurred years ago, and Mara is beginning to process this anguish, which only makes the conflict within her even more difficult. It's far easier for Mara simply to hate Luke, but she finds herself needing his help in this third book, and her situation becomes only more complicated, when the alliance learns of her history with the Empire!Sadly, Winter plays a minimal role in this book. I always found her to be one of the more fascinating characters with her photographic memory. She spends most of her time caring for Leia's child in this book. Leia makes a big power play, going off on a limb to lend aid to the Noghri, a race of short lizard-like aliens that have been loyal to the Empire, but only because of their respect for Lord Vader. Leia uses her investigative and diplomatic skills to utilize this inherited esteem, which ultimately results in significant effects.Many other exciting challenges take place for Luke Skywalker in this book. Master C'boath, Thrawn and a few other surprises along the way keep him more off his feet than usual! There is so much else that happens, that is masterfully resolved in this book it would take too long to describe. The smuggler Talon Karrde attempts to rally the rest of his smuggler associates against the empire, which proves to be a very difficult task. Every storyline in this book is entertaining, and finds a way to wrap itself into the significance of the overall conclusion.  I only had one problem with this book, and it has to do with a rather silly quote in one of the final chapters having to do with Thrawn's fascination with art. You'll know it when you get to it. For that to be one of the only things that really bothered me about the book though is amazing, because I'm usually really picky. This book is defiantly a good pay-off if you weren't as impressed with the first two. Timothy Zahn makes this one count, and puts in a lot of great moments as well as excellent conclusions.",5,"US"
2017-06-16,"Excellent","This series is great. The author did a masterful job of telling what happens after the Emperor falls and how the last of his Empire fight for what they feel is right and how the New Republic forms amongst all that drama. I recommend all Star Wars fans to read this series.",5,"US"
2014-09-24,"BEST STAR WARS BOOK EVER!!!!!!","the reason I'm giving this book the 5 star is simply out of appreciation for the author's fantastic work. Like all the books of the Thrawn Trilogy, it was fast-paced, witty, action-packed, and compelling. Everything in the Star Wars we know and love. This one however eclipsed the past two completely. The conclusion involved the internal struggle of Mara Jade as she wrestles with the decision of fulfilling her dead master's last command and Luke prepares for his final battle with the psychotic dark jedi Joruus C'baoth. The battle against the empire seemed hopeless as we keep seeing the new republic pounded by Thrawn's clone troopers and dark force fleet to the point where the reader thinks: Are they going to do it? Will the New Republic prevail? What's going to happen?! Zahn does a good job of building up all this hatred toward C'aboth and yet understanding why he is what he is. I liked seeing what was happening in both fleets and every move they pulled. Nice that the military theme in Star Wars was expressed. Something that was glossed over in other books. Last thing, my most favorite part of the book was the events speeding up to the end and the most epic conclusion in science fiction; including the last battle against C'baoth which brings out a big surprise. I won't give spoilers but I'll give you a hint: A duel of the soul in a dark cave. Thank you Timothy Zahn for writing such a great book worthy of Star Wars! Thank you and may the force be with you!!!",5,"US"
2011-10-23,"Review of the Kindle version","For days, I have been trapped in the Star Wars universe reading Timothy Zahn's trilogy.  My poor husband had to suffer from me reading The Last Command (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 3) through the night.  All I can say is WOW.Zahn once again recreates the Star Wars universe in all its glory.  All the main characters remain true to themselves and maturing as we would expect.  Leia and Han are parents, Luke is all grown up.  Lando is becoming much more likeable (I never did like him in the movies).I can honestly say I'm not crazy about the ysalamari or C'baoth, although I guess it's better to make the Master insane than be someone we have to take seriously.Thrawn redeemed himself to me.  I can finally accept him as Grand Admiral, ironically because of what happens to him at the end.  Up until that point, I felt his portrayal was a little unreal.  II'm in love with the interplay between Mara and Luke.  It was brilliantly crafted.  This is why the Star Wars movies were so successful -- the interaction between the characters.  Zahn brings it all back.  Hints and allusions weaving in and out of the story.  I knew it from the beginning.  Mara Jade is undeniably the best addition to the Star Wars universe.  I absolutely adore her.  Pair her with Luke and it's magic.I'm so glad Zahn was picked to do this trilogy.  He brought back the characters we all know and love in a way very few authors ever could.  This last book ties up some loose ends; but it thankfully leaves a lot more to explore, which is why I'm off to read the ""Hand of Thrawn"" duology.(If you're thinking about the Kindle version, it is mostly well formatted with a few spelling/grammatical errors and some spacing problems.  For the most part, those things did not detract much from my reading experience.)",5,"US"
2013-08-14,"Yagyu review","This was an amazing book. A wonderful end to an amazing trilogy.Pros:1: It was so Artfully done. This is actually a quote from Thrawn at the end but once you read it and see why he said it, im sure you will agree.2: C'baoth. Joruus C'baoth reaches his peak insanity and lets the darkside fully consume him making for a great villain and successor to Palpatine.3: Mara Jade. She really shines here in this book and overcomes allot of the brain washing that Palpatine did to her.4: Luke and Luuke. Luke feels about right in this, hes still trying to save rather then kill which makes sense and follows his character well in return of the Jedi.5: Noghri. They really get awesome in this book and we see them get some justice.Cons:1: Luke and Luuke? Theres a clone and the spelling of the name well yeah, just like the C'baoth clone its spelling is a little annoying. I love Zahns writing but i think saying so and so's clone would have been better then just doubling a letter in the name.2: No grand lightsaber duel. Well technically this isnt true, Mara and Luke do get to use their sabers. But I really wanted to see C'baoth's skill with a Lightsaber.Nothing really else bad to say about the book. Its an awesome read. So go check it out!!!",5,"US"
2017-12-17,"Legends should be canon","After seeing the latest movie, I am sad to say that Disney is killing the Star Wars of my youth.  These stories, ""Legends"" as they are now called, are so much better and it is sad that they are not canon. They understand what it means to be Star Wars and captures it nearly perfectly.",5,"US"
2018-01-17,"Exciting","This is a really good Star Wars novel, the culmination of the series is fast paced and exciting. It is nicely written and enjoyable. The only reason why I don’t give it 5 stars is because it seems to use too many of the story elements from other Star Wars stories for my liking, mainly Return of the Jedi, so a little deduction for that.",4,"US"
2013-09-11,"The Climatic Finish","In this final episode of the Thrawn Trilogy, we watch as the questionable choices that Leia, Han, and Lando made come to fruition. During the previous two books, we watched this trio make choices that seemed very risky and its in this book that we watch the pieces of the puzzle fall into place.  The brilliant Grand Admiral Thrawn seems to out smart the Republic at every turn, and it's only through the culmination of fringe efforts that defy logic, and the growing strife between the Admiral and Jedi Master Cboath that the Empire can be stopped.",5,"US"
2014-12-06,"Great series, really captures that classic Star Wars magic","This series is awesome. If you are on the fence go for it. Fans of the original trilogy will dig it for sure and this last book might be the best one. Great ending in my opinion. This really has that Star Wars ""magic"" and feel to it. Great writing and characters. I was weird about reading them because  Episode 7 is coming out soon and it will not follow this as the Expanded Universe is not canon but I don't regret it one bit. I believe that DIsney and Abrams are doing a great job with the new Star Wars from what I have read and seen and I am confident that I will be able to enjoy that story in conjunction with this one even though they are not about the same characters. Check it out!",5,"US"
2014-01-05,"Great final book to the 'Thrawn' trilogy","Third and lat book of the 'Thrawn' trilogy, the entire set tells weaves a mighty fine story throughout the three books. Zahn has done a superb job on this story. It's adventuresome, fun, filled with well fleshed-out charcters, and vey intelligent. Never dull and nicely paced I found it hard to put down. Didn't want the books to come to an end.Space battles, new and powerful enemies, intrigue in the New Republic government and old grudges to be settled. All the gang is here and they're very entertaining!These three books are the best of all the supplemental SW books, in my opinion of course.",5,"US"

2000-07-16,"Audio Rendition is Excellent","Timothy Zahn tops himself with a slap bang ending to this Star Wars saga.  There is not much I can add to other reviews.  However, the audio book is abridged and some of the story seems to skip forward at high speed.  Once  again Anthony Daniels (C3PO) does a great job reading.  His voice  characterizations are the same as in ""Dark Force Rising"" allowing  the listener to keep the many characters straight and concentrate on the  plot(s).  The audio and special effects are crisp and clear and easily  understood in a car environment.  The best of the three books and well  worth the purchase price.  Run time:  180 minutes.",5,"US"
2013-03-31,"Excellent and leaves you wishing for more.","Strongly recommended.  Zahn's writing captures the feel of the movies and Star Wars universe. This was the Star Was expanded universe before Lucas let it run amuck with ever growing numbers of basically lousy writing and poorly thought-out continuations.  You feel these stories fit well and would have made excellent movies.  You don't have over-the-top characters like the Vong or million ship mega battles that simply feel like cop-out rather than well considered Star Wars scenarios.",5,"US"
2013-04-14,"Great series on the go!","I really have been wanting to read this series. I unfortunately can no longer find the HC trilogy for a reasonable price. I noticed I could get this on Kindle and thought, why not? I am usually not a very big into digital purchases for some things but I am quite happy with this purchase and can't wait to read these books!

I was always enthralled by George Lucas's groundbreaking films, but it wasn't until I read Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy that I became a genuine Star War's fanatic. Zahn captures the audience in the first book of his three part series and doesn't not fail to keep the reader entranced throughout the conclusion of The Last Command.  Zahn's mastery of the art of suspense will keep any reader engaged and captivated, whether he or she is a novice Star War's fan, as I was, or a seasoned Star War's fanatic. After reading The Last command, I could not get enough of the world of Star Wars. Timothy Zahn's The Last Command is a must read for anyone who claims to love Star Wars.I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did and I hope that you will be encouraged by Zahn to further explore the intricate galaxy of Star Wars.",5,"US"

I dived right it and must admit this is the best Star Wars read I have found. The new characters have fantastic back stories and fit into the story line well, they are not far fetched and plucked out of know where. Their existence is justified and with significant meaning to the Star Wars storyMy usual Star Wars reads consist of more well known characters from the movies - novels like Tarkin, Darth Maul Shadow Hunter and The Dark Trilogy. However from now on I will be reading more EU literature - as soon as I have read the last in the Thrawn trilogy that is.",5,"UK"
2010-10-11,"A great continuation from the original trilogy","So I wanted to try another Star Wars novel after reading and enjoying Death Troopers last year. The question was - where to start? There are plenty of Star Wars Expanded Universe books out there, with more and more being released at present. However, I wanted something that would really only need me to have watched the films, at which point I stumbled across the Thrawn trilogy by Timothy Zahn. It's set 5 years after the end of the original trilogy and picks up with the characters I know from the films - all leading to me deciding that it was the way to go. Of course, while looking around I discovered that it's a series of Star Wars books that is rated very highly indeed. So, off I went to see what Heir to the Empire held in store...As mentioned, I'm not someone that is overly familiar with the Star Wars universe outside the main films, so before starting Heir to the Empire I did question whether or not I'd be lost with any additional things that had been raised within the setting since the films. Fortunately this is one of the strong points about Heir to the Empire - it's perfect for EU virgins like myself!Picking up events 5 years after the original trilogy ended we join Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo & Chewbacca as they are part of the New Republic and trying to build upon the chaos that was thrown up when the Empire was defeated. Living on Coruscant they are trying to bring in more planets to the New Republic to strengthen it and make it a democratic government for the member planets. Luke is still learning more as a Jedi and is now teaching Leia to build her powers and control over the Force and Han and Leia are married with Leia pregnant expecting twins, Leia is doing her part as a senator for the New Republic while Han is trying to build links with smugglers to help out with legit cargo hauls. Suffice to say that events have carried on nicely from the film in a totally believable way with each of the main characters using their strengths to help build the New Republic.However, a new enemy has arrived to take control of the old Imperial fleet - Grand Admiral Trawn. He's the last of the Empires high ranking military people and is a genius in what he does, able to think outside the box and knows his enemies weaknesses. He resides on the Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera, a ship under the command of Captain Pallaeon, and directs the fleet from there in an effort to rebuild the Empire to its former glory and defeat the New Republic. Along the way he makes kidnap attempts on Leia and Luke, and also stumbles across an old Jedi by the name of Joruus C'Baoth who is not quite what meets the eye.Apart from the above mentioned new characters we also have some others thrown into the mix, namely Talon Karrde and Mara Jade. Karrde is a big time smuggler, one of the biggest still operating while Jade is his subordinate, and one with an interesting past that is slowly revealed throughout the story. Thrawn is the main bad guy though, but he's one that is a refreshing change from what I've seen in the films and has a much more controlled manner, able to think about the long term goals and carry them out with efficiency. Pallaeon is there more for us to learn more of Thrawn and show how the old ways are not always still used, but he does do the job very well.While the story is fairly straight forward, there are some very interesting new additions to the universe. The two most important of these are the Emperor's store that is located on a hidden away planet and the other is the revelation of the ysalamiri, a species native to the planet where Karrde is based and one that has a very unique and spectacular ability - their presence nullifies the Force, completely. Both these play a large role in the story and help add a new depth to the universe, allowing Zahn to flex his creative muscles in many ways.Suffice to say that if you're a fan of the original trilogy then this is by far the best way to go to explore what happened after the films. It's got a great story and an interesting antagonist, while Luke, Leia and Han all keep the continuity from the films very nicely. I'm very eager to start on the second of this series and do so looking forward to see where the story takes us. All in all I was very impressed and thoroughly pleased to find a Star Wars story worthy of the first trilogy, not like those prequels Lucas insisted on releasing - this would have been a much better direction to go.",4,"UK"
1999-01-18,"A man deadlier than the emperor has appeared:Admiral Thrawn","Thrawn is an evil genuis who wishes to restore the empire in his image.His captain,Palleon is an equally ruthless man and a very good destroyer  captain. Thrawn, who is one of the 11 Imperial grand admirals can predict  to the letter what his opponents will do. It is important to note that  Thrawn is an alien and to anyone who know of the Empire's anti-alien  policy, you must assume that he is outstanding in order to assume his  position as an Imperial Grand Admiral.  He does this by studying their  species artwork. His overall strategy is to destroy the rebel shipping and  capture rebel ships to use in the small Imperial navy. Another standard  imperial tool is terror. He seeks the help of a mad jedi master to help  communicate between ships and increase coordination during shielded  attacks. My favorite character in this book is Mara Jade, a rougish woman  similar to Han.  If you are to buy this book, I recommend that you buy the  other books in the triology because otherwise you will not be able to  survive the suspense.",5,"UK"
1998-04-15,"Where are the characters?","Interesting.  Slightly too overblown. Do they really need to spend that much time going from place to place to place to place?  Disappointed in the characterizations of our favorites.  Granted George didn't exactly go overboard to create the deepest characters in the universe, but they at least ""breathed"".  Zahn's treatments of Leia, Han and Luke are cursory at best. ( And stop with the movie line quotes already!!!!  In-jokes are fine, but every other paragraph?  New dialog, please.)  The 'droids were stock, and Chewie as well.  Lando alone seemed to live on the pages (and not often enough).  Zahn must like scoundrels - and also must consider Han completely reformed!For the new characters, I found myself most drawn to Talon Kaarde. (another scoundrel)  He, at least, changes and breathes.  He's a man I'd like to get to know better, like Lando was in Empire.  What led to him being a Smuggler King?  Where was he when Jabba fell? Or was he somewhere on Tatooine as well - seemed like everyone else was.  He cares just enough about his people so you can like him and is just ruthless enough so you'll squirm waiting for which way he'll jump.  His conversion to the Rebel's cause was slow enough to be believable, convoluted enough to be interesting and echoed the transition Han Solo made much more swiftly in New Hope.  (as Leia comments in one of these books somewhere)  Of course, I hope he and Mara can make it work - she need's a little happiness now.  Luke is wrong for her and Kaarde's the better man, at least in this series.  Sorry Luke!  (of course, I haven't read any of the other Star Wars books yet, either)  Despite myself, I liked Mara Jade.  You knew she'd turn to the Light in the end, which made her a bit of a puppet, but it was a clever way to resolve her problems.  Always wondered what happened to that hand. . .  Sure, Mara's a smart ass, but she's a very unhappy smart ass.  And George has already firmly established that the Rebels can be funny and the Imperials are always serio!us.Nice to see you again Wedge!  Keep flying.The Grand Admiral's insights through art were interesting and mildly plausible if you also have complete psych. profiles for the entire species as well - not just the artists - - but if you have the psych profile, why look at the art?  I swallowed Thrawn's use of the art ""chosen"" by the Senator as an indicator of actions much more easily.  It was also nice to see a competent bad guy again, someone who actually made you worry and made serious inroads on the New Republic.There's a challenge!While I didn't find these books ""wonderful"" as some of the other reviewers did, I did enjoy them for their glimpse back into George's galaxy.  Not a waste of time or money, but then I bought the series used.",3,"UK"
1996-12-28,"Zahn's Trilogy Not Quite Worthy of the Star Wars Title","Timothy Zahn's books ""Heir to the Empire"", ""Dark ForceRising"", and ""The Last Command"" are good books, don't get me wrong. I just don't think they measure up to the Star Wars mythos. Characterization is poor. All of the characters sound exactly alike. Without the phrases ""said Luke"" or ""Han shouted"", I wouldn't have been able to tell one guy from the other. I found Han saying things that I just couldn't imagine Harrison Ford saying, and it was the same way with Luke, Leia, Lando, etc. Another thing that irked me was the way the characters kept finishing each other's sentences. After three books of this, one may become rather annoyed. Some of the original characters are uninteresting as well. While the plot was fast-paced and entertaining, the reader doesn't get the full Star Wars experience. Zahn should have paid more attention to characters and dialogue.",4,"UK"
1997-04-03,"Sequel to the most favorite science fiction series","The most popular science-fiction still continues, Star WarsHeir To The Empire continues where Return Of The Jedi left off.  Hugo Award winning author Timothy Zahn continues the St ar Wars triolgy with the same force and excitment like the others before.  Heir To The Empire is the first book of a three book cycle of the Star Wars Triolgy, followed by the book entiled Dark Forces Rising and The Last Command. ItÕs been five years after Return Of The Jedi, the destruction of the Death Star, and the defeat of Darth Vader and the Emperor.  But in a distant part of the galaxy, an old Imperial Starfleet exists. Commanded by the Grand Admiral Thrawn, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and the Rebel Alliance are in for another battle.  Princess Leia and Han Solo are married and are expecting Jedi twins.  There is a whole new line of characters such as Captain Pellaeon, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the twins.  But still around are characters such as Han Solo, Leia, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and Lando.  The story is filled with excitement, heroic battles, and the battle between the Force and the Dark side. The story keeps the same unique twist, just like the rest of the Star Wars sequels.  I rate the book an 8.5 because I personally like the first Star Wars stories but keep in mind this is the first of three other stories to come and itÕs the build up for the other stories. Go and check it out... and remember ÒMay the Force be with you.Ó",5,"UK"
1997-07-14,"Incredible!","Heir to the Empire - this book started it all. Frankly, I was nota Star Wars fan until I've read it. I watched movies now andthen, but nothing more than that. I've heard rumors that there isa sequel, something about Jedi twins, but dismissed it as gossip.Then, one day I saw it in the bookstore - so, it wasn't a rumorafter all. I bought it, went home and for a fews days the worldaround me dimmed. I was in SW Universe, the one I've never seebefore.Timothy Zahn performed an incredible deed. He managed to createeven more bright characters and worthy opponents than originalmovies did. One fan gave them short descriptions:""Thrawn - he is totaly cool Pellaeon - pride of the Military, C'baoth - he kicks f**ing a**! Talon Kardde - he's a man's man, Mara - my love in another life, Noghri - I like 'em"".",5,"UK"
2013-03-16,"Great book bad delivery","Firstly, I have nothing against the book but the state it was in when delivered was appalling. The package was wide open with papers cramed in. The book has been bent and I expected better.",2,"UK"
1999-06-06,"Fabulous","People write things like ""Duh, it's a Galactic Republic, so how can Thrawn hurt them by attacking shipyards?""  Dense, maybe?  They're  still technically rebels, they call it the New Republic so the galaxy will  be content, but they don't have as nearly much power as the Old Republic  and Empire (it's even called fragile on the back of the book, and is  continually called fragile on many other novels).  Also, the  ""pathetic"" Empire in this book is supposed to be small.  The  Battle of Endor annihilated most Imperial leaders.  Thrawn works with what  he has, thus ""remnants of the Imperial fleet,"" as stated on the  back cover, too.  Because this is not a movie, Thrawn has to set up a  complex story line that makes you want to read further.  Alas, many  illiterates will have trouble with it, because the movies are by nature  less cerebral than Zahn's novels (but not less exciting). They have to be  or people would think they're just boring films.  The space battles's  excitement depends on your imagination; if you rush through this book, it  will seem confusing, of course.  And no, there aren't fuzzy Ewoks or other  stupid creatures in this book, because Zahn is a serious sci-fi writer.  This is a dark trilogy, comparable to The Empire Strikes Back.  Therefore,  many won't enjoy it.  But don't give it 1 star if you don't understand it,  please.  And that's another point; this is a trilogy, so treat it like one  and read all the books, you'll be more satisfied. P.S. Many planets in the  SW galaxy have only one settlement on them, if you watch the films closely.  Whoever said Zahn's continuation of this fact was stupid is a poor-learned  person.",5,"UK"
1998-12-11,"one of the best sci-fi novels ever","This has to be the best star wars book out there. Zahn captures the action, ezcitment, and mystery of the movies.  1) Sophisticated language makes a good book. It adds that  intellignet feeling to it.  2) The intent, from my perspective, in not  saying what happened to the other Grand Admirals was to allow other authors  the chance to elaborate on that. Personally, I like my novels with that  kind mystery in them  3) I'm 13 years old, 11 when I read the book, and I  understood what ""cocking and eyebrow"" meant. I read that  terminallagy all the time. If you adults can't see the obvious, it's not  Zahn's fault  4) At the Battle of Endor, the EXECUTER was destroyed. Zahn  explains quite clearly how a good deal of the Empire's best and brightest  were on it. He said it was the fast track to premotion, and remember, Vader  was the Emperor's right hand man. He could have gotten anyone he wanted on  his own personal Star Destroyer.  5) In the novels preceding Heir to the  Empire, the Empire suffered defeat after defeat at the Alliance's hands. It  is perfectly pluasible that the Empire didn't have alot of ships.  Heir  to the Empire was an excellent book. Zahn receives applause from not only  me, but the thousands of others who enjoyed his novels. I would suggest  reading the other two novels in this trilogy, and reading the Hand of  Thrawn books.",5,"UK"
1998-06-07,"Possibly the best series of SWs novels","I bought this the moment I first saw it in hardcover. I was stunned and excited, wanting more the moment I turned the final page! ""How can I stand to wait another year,"" I thought to myself. You must Realize that the year was 1991, and we hadn't heard anything from our favorite galaxy far, far away in 8 years! If you're reading it for the first time, let the books move you along at its own pace (didn't Master Yoda say something about patience?). I had to say ""If you read any Star Wars novels...blah, blah, blah,"" because Zahn's final follow-up books begining with Spectre of the Past (I think that's the title), which is also amazing, and the Black Fleet Crisis should increase the pleasure of following our favorite heroes. Read some of Zahn's other works and you'll see that he is an excellent choice to write about the further adventures of Luke Skywalker.",5,"UK"
1998-02-21,"A perfect example of why Zahn is a Hugo winner","I loved this book (and the entire trilogy)! The ""Heir to the Empire"" is the best SW novel I have read and one of the best sci-fi novels I have read in a long time. The characters (both old and new) are well-developed and interesting. Leia, Luke, and Han remained in character. I could hear the actors' voices saying their lines. I don't usually like the villians, but I made an exception in this case. I loved Mara Jade and her interaction with Luke was wonderful. Admiral Thawn was a wonderful adversary. As much as I hated him I also grudgingly respected him. The strategy match between the Alliance and Thawn was engaging. I like seeing competent bad guys. Sometimes the Imperials seem to have left their brain at home. This book is a worthwhile read whether you are a casual fan or a major fan. Also, check out some of Zahn's other books. The author has definite talent.",5,"UK"
1998-04-06,"Good stuff in the Star Wars tradition!","Timothy Zahn's ""Thrawn Trilogy"" is, in my opinion, the best Star Wars fiction available beyond the movies. Zahn is one of the best writers I have come across in some time. His style is excellent. The plots of the books in this trilogy are captivating and interesting, yet not difficult to follow or unreasonable in light of the original trilogy. His characterization of the familiar characters as well as some wonderful new ones is superb: Luke, Leia and Han develop just as we might expect them to be developing five years after ""Return of the Jedi""; the characters talk like we're used to hearing them talk (unlike in some of the other Star Wars novels, where they don't sound at all like themselves); and the new characters fit right into the Star Wars universe as if Lucas had intended to put them in the movies all along. Zahn's themes are interesting and well-developed, fitting well in the context of the themes developed in the movies. In all, I would definitely recommend this book to any Star Wars fan who is looking to expand his or her experience of Star Wars beyond the movies. It is a great trilogy.",5,"UK"
1998-07-18,"A Star Wars story worthy of waiting eight years for!","Timothy Zahn did a great job on this book. With HTTE, Zahn put Star Wars back into the minds of former Star Wars fans that forgot the Trilogy during the '80's. Zahn did a good job of capturing the Star Wars characters' essence into the book. He also made some great new characters. Grand Admiral Thrawn was a great villain. I mean, how can you beat someone who can triple-guess you or tell about you from your art? And Talon Karrde's organization was a good group of characters. Look at Mara Jade. She has been in at least half of the following novels and stories, and the main character in a LucasArts computer game (Mysteries of the Sith). I also liked his talent to describe places or ships. I did think it was a little hard to keep track of where the constantly moving characters were. If you like SF, read this book and the following sequels.",5,"UK"
1996-07-06,"A First for All Star Wars Fans","This is the first book written about the Star Wars universethat went beyond the boundries of George Lucas' imaginaryuniverse.  Few books had been written before Heir to theEmpire, but many followed.  This book was written in trueStar Wars form.  The original characters act as you would expectthem to and the interaction between them and the new charactersis true to the form created by the movies.  While inspiring andcaptivating this book starts us on a whole new Star Wars adventurebeyond the movies.  You can now continue to see what happens to yourfavorite characters and you send your imagination soaringonce again.  Timothy Zahn is the one author, of all those trying tocapture the essence of the Star Wars universe, that can say hehas succeeded.  Read this book.",5,"UK"
1998-01-18,"I LOVE THIS BOOK","This os really a great book especially for all true STAR WARS fans, such as myself.  This book gives you information on some of the movie charachters that you'd only know by reading this book.  This book got me hooked.  I loved this book so much it it was the first in a collection of over 40 STAR WARS books that I have now.  My favorite charachters in this book are Grand Admiral Thrawn, for his incredible military genius and his devistating attacks on the New Republic.  I also like the Noghri death commandos for there deadly fighting style making these 1.3 meter tall aliens one of the most deadly races in the galaxy.  I highly recommend this book and the ones that follow.  Also I urge any one who has any intrest what so ever in STAR WARS to get your hands on any and every book pretaning to the subject.",5,"UK"
1999-06-06,"The one to read first","Set 5 years after Episode VI (ROTJ), but the first  novel sequel to the SW trilogy, Timothy Zahn does a marvelous job at creating a whole new universe  of compelling characters and events.  Interestingly different from the  flash-and-bang movies, Zahn sets up a complex story of twists and turns;  unlike The Phantom Menace, it's hard to tell what's going to happen next.  Anyone who says his style is boring is off-balance.  Thrawn is the real  genius of the Empire; obviously, with a larger fleet, he would have crushed  the New Republic.  I also think Mara Jade, though increasingly annoying  with her hatred of Luke, has a well-written history.  Definitely read all 5  of his books, including his new two-parter.  Then read the graphic novels,  they have great illustrations.  By far one of the top 5 best SW novels.",5,"UK"
1997-07-10,"What is Zahn trying to prove?","Timothy Zahn wanted very badly to prove that heknows Star Wars. He took it to such an extreme that the characters were ludicrously exaggerated,almost like charicatures. He spent so much of his book trying to show off his knowledge, the thought that he was supposed to be writing a good Star Wars novel must have slipped his mind. The characters were so off, I often found myself laughing so hard I couldn't continue reading. I finally finished the book, and when reflecting on the storyline and charaters, I felt so disappointed. Han and Leia are supposed to be in love. They never even see each other. It is made very clear that Leia doesn't care about her unborn children. Luke is supposed to be a Jedi. Jedis are serious, I suppose, but doesn't Luke get to do anything? All he did was sit and whine whenever asked to use his powers. Lando is supposed to be a nice guy. In this book, he acts as if he doesn't even like Luke, Leia, Han, and the rest. This book has a very tiring and predictible pattern: Someone plans an attack. The intended narrowly escapes and flees. Grand Admiral Thrawn somehow figures out exactly what they've done. Grand Admiral Thrawn sends out Noghri to attack again, and the wearying, neverending process begins again. Not to mention, even if Thrawn is quite clever-I find it extremely hard to believe that he can figure out the actions of anyone in an entire culture by briefly studying a few people's art. This book frustrated me to a point where I wanted to hurl it to the floor and rip it to shreds. Maybe the rest of the trilogy won't be quite as bad.",2,"UK"
1999-05-01,"PRETTY GOOD","When I read this book I felt, that I need more (thanx god that there is a sequel :)). This book is just fantastic. It has great story and two new  characters. Grand admiral Thrawn and Dark Jedi C'Baoth. Both are put very  good in the story. I have never asked myself why are they here, how did  they get here, ... without expecting an answer. And I got it. There's only  one thing that I don't like too much: Grand admiral Thrawn is darn smart.  I have no clue, how he guesses all these things. But probably that's just  one of his secret things. Maybe this will be explained in the sequel I'm  just reading. Otherwise there is no other thing that i would find wrong. Or  maybe just a little too much pushing with Leia fighting (damn, she is  pregnant). If you haven't read this book ... read it ... and enjoy it.",5,"UK"
1999-01-03,"Finish what you start.","For those people who only read ""Heir to the Empire"" and decided they didn't like it, continue reading the rest of the trilogy. Only reading  the first book of a trilogy is like only reading 1/3 of a story. One can't  base an opinion of a story only having read a fraction of it. Besides of  those people who reviewed the entire trilogy 93% gave five stars. Those are  good odds.I gave the trilogy four stars. Unfortunatly Mr.Zahn was  unable, or unwilling, to add new 'catch phrases', for lack of a better  term. Example, Han solo would only refer to threepio as ""Golden  rod"" The first time was O.k. but I got tired of it. I'm sure Solo  would have called him ""Threepio"" at least once.  I guess Mr.Zahn  thought it was very amussing but it got anoying.Basically If you like  star wars read it. It is a good trilogy, and very entertaining. The plot is  plausible, and The characters are great.Anyway if you want to  continue the Star Wars saga read the trilogy, The entire trilogy. Give  Mr.Zahn the courtisy to read his complete work.The End.",4,"UK"
1997-08-15,"Heir to a Legacy","Timothy Zahn has been for many years a respected author in the science fiction genre. The Star Wars films have long been regarded as breakthroughs not only in science fiction, but in moviemaking itself. The combination of the two has made an entire trilogy of books, the incredible sequels to the original Star Wars Trilogy. The first book, Heir to the Empire, introduces the cunning Grand Admiral Thrawn, who has united the remnants of the Empire in order to destroy the fledgeling New Republic and re-instate the Empire as the ultimate rulers of the universe. With him, the dark Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth, dangerously mad and plotting to steal the unborn Jedi children of Han Solo and Princess Leia. Could this be a new reign of tyranny? Will the pitiful New Republic survive?",5,"UK"
1999-05-09,"The BEST Star Wars book!","As the whopping 150th reviewer of Timothy Zahn's first installment in this trilogy, I suppose my word doesn't count for much. Regardless, I believe  this trilogy, which essentially rekindled the Star Wars interest in 1991  which we all know has grown into a monolith juggernaut, is the ONLY good  Star Wars literature of the revival period (1991-now). The characters are  the best to come along: Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Joruus C'Baoth, Talon  Kaard. After this trilogy, the SW novels spiraled downward as every loser  who walks by the camera in every SW movie has been the star of three  volumes of mediochre literature. If you are looking for new SW adventures,  ""Heir to the Empire"" and the two sequels are the best way to go.  Already vintage Star Wars!",5,"UK"
1996-12-27,"The best Star Wars saga continuation to date","Zahn has created a continuation like no other. This trilogy is simply the best. The reader will be drawn in by Zahn's amazing story and clever, intriguing characters. If you read only 1 Star Wars book, this is the one.  It will make you read the rest of the trilogy, and leave you hungry for more. The only drawback: where do you go from the top? Every other book in the Star Wars series pales in comparison to this novel. The only exceptions are the novels written by Kevin J. Anderson (The Jedi Academy Trilogy & Darksaber) and The Courtship of Princess Leia. Oh, and Shadows of the Empire is pretty good, as are The Corellian Trilogy (Roger Macbride Allen) and the Black Fleet Trilogy (Michael P. Kube-McDowell). But, they are still not as great as Zahn's books.",5,"UK"
1999-05-29,"Generally weak, overrated.","Compared to some of the other Star Wars books out there (Children of the Jedi, The Courtship of Princess Leia,) Heir to the Empire (and the other  two books of this series) are pretty good.  However, I find this book to be  rather overrated by most people.  For one, the characters that Zahn  introduces are not all that interesting.  The story's main villian (Grand  Admirial Thrawn) is a cool-headed genius who plots and schemes and rarely  makes a mistake, however we are given no real insight into who Thrawn is.  The smuggler boss, Talon Karrde, is similar to Thrawn in that he is also  cool-headed and smart, and basically emotionless.  The worst thing about  this book is undoubtably the dialog.  As has been noted by other reviewers,  Zahn REPEATEDLY uses the same expressions and phrases for all his  characters, under almost all circumstances.  It makes all the dialog sound  the same and sound very uninteresting.  Everybody always doing ""wry  grins"" and saying things wryly and ""squeezing their thumb and  forefinger together"" (whatever that is,) and saying ""Point,""  ""Agreed,"" talking in cool, carefully modulated voices.  It's  stupid and it got on my nerves.  While the overall plot was okay, the  weak characters and dialog really spoil the series.  At times, it's like  you want to know what happens next, getting to the next part is sometimes  painful because of the poor dialog, and somewhat lacking descriptions.  And it really doesn't feel like Star Wars too me.  There is more wallowing  in grey areas than good vs. evil stuff, there is little drama and no color,  and no cool special effects.  A lot of people recommend this as the  first Star Wars book you should read, but I personally don't.  I think the  X-Wing Series is probably the best series out right now.  Although it  doesn't star any of the main characters of the movies, that is part of  what's so great about it... all the characters are new and fresh and are  developed from scratch.",2,"UK"
2018-05-31,"it's better in audio format","I used to have the proper book of this, it's better in audio format, the story is set just after the events of Return of the Jedi, with the remnants of the Empire.",5,"UK"
1998-04-09,"Facinating ,the best,and action packed!!!","You looking for a good book.You downright bored.well boy do I have a book for you.Heir to the Empire is simply the best.

The plot is very interesting Grand Admiral  Thrawn has somes plan for domination that will take your breath away. He has found a dark jedi, hidden in the depths of the star wars galaxy and is using him to his bidden while contoling him with ysalmiri creatures that block out the force from Jedi's. You can't even tell  how this trilogy will go or end by just reading this first book.

1998-12-23,"Almost","The story was great, it was just what I wanted from a Star Wars story. But as I came to think about it later on, it occured to me that this story  wouldn't have been so appealing without the ""Star Wars""-logo in  the cover. And the characters of course. Also, Zahn has a habit of  repeating those old phrases from the movies like Lando or Han Solo saying  'It wasn't my fault!' etc. I know it sounds a bit weird but it really  ticked me off while reading it. I mean, surely the writer can make out  these so called 'flying frases' himself. I enjoyed description on Kashyyk,  the Wookie-planet. More of that and less refrences to the original movies  and it would have been perfect.",4,"UK"
2016-03-16,"Old Reliable comes through again.","I loved this book. Timothy Zahn is a genius when it comes to creating multi-dimensional villains. If I remember aright, this was one of the first Expanded Universe books to be written, and set  the tone for nearly fifty years of Star Wars Fiction.

2015-08-04,"The BEST Star Wars novel","I bought this after reading several star wars novels and hearing Disney did away with the old canon universe.  It was highly recommend by a friend and did not disappoint.  The book moves and feels like it could be an actual star wars movie.

You will want them.",5,"US"

Speaking as one of those nerds, I've read quite a few of the Star Wars novels, and the entire Hand of Thrawn trilogy is one of the few that stands on it's own not just as a good Star Wars series, but as an excellent general science fiction story as well. Timothy Zahn has an eye for detail that escapes most authors of any genre, and has carefully crafted a fantastic story that has something for every reader to enjoy.The trilogy focuses both on the difficulties of setting up a new government to replace the old Empire, the number of things still mysterious and unknown even in a well-known universe, and the artful style with which a true strategist could use the resources of the Star Wars universe.If I could rate it higher than five stars, I would.",5,"US"

I've been a Star Wars guy all my life and I have never got this addicted to any Star Wars fan fiction. Although I was a little disappointed by the sudden ending and some of the context of the book, like the corny one liners, but it's a great read.Unlike the majority of the fan fiction authors, Zahn really brings the characters to life as Lucas originally portrayed them. If this book does indeed become a movie, it will be a real good one.",4,"US"
2002-05-04,"You can see it in your mind's eye!","Darkhorse did a most excellent job on this graphic novel. It is practically a story board for the film- you can SEE it in your mind's eye. As for the story itself, I think it is the best since the original Episode 4. There are so many subplots and plot twists that it is impossible to be bored- combined with the what should be a barrage of special effects and exotic sets, it should be overwhelming.  It isn't all special effects, though. There are some powerful dramatic scenes here. I can see where some of them (like the last stand of the Jedi) may go down in cinematic history. There is also IDEALISM here. It is like George Lucas is winning back the soul of his creation after certain politicians and arms merchants coopted the Star Wars name for their own agenda....",5,"US"
2014-02-26,"The Book That Re-Started the Expanded Universe","After the original Star Wars films ended with the release of Return of the Jedi, the interest in the franchise waned, seeming to end with the cancellation of the Marvel run in 1986. There appeared to be no market anymore for stories set in the galaxy far, far away, but some at Lucasfilm disagreed, so they pitched an idea to their superiors for further Star Wars adventures. They argued that these new adventures should take the form of novels set in the time period after Return of the Jedi.Once they received approval from George Lucas and the other higher-ups, they searched for a writer to pen this new trilogy, and decided to offer the contract for the trilogy to then-rising science-fiction writer Timothy Zahn. Thus, what would become known as The Thrawn Trilogy was born.The first book, Heir to the Empire outsold the modest hopes that had been held out for the books, and much more. It was a run-away best-seller that proved that there was still a HUGE market for SW stories. Timothy Zahn went on to become, for many fans, the definitive author of the EU (Expanded Universe) of SW stories.Twenty years after the initial release of Heir, Timothy Zahn released a special annotated version of the novel, with helpful notes, observations, and explanations from himself and (every once in a while) Betsy Mitchell, his editor at Random House.Of course the story is terrific fun. It takes us five years after the end of Jedi, where the Rebel Alliance has made huge gains since their victory over the Emperor at the Battle of Endor. In those five years, the Rebellion have established a formal government (called the ""New Republic"" as a continuation of the Old Republic Palpatine ended in his Sith plot), pushed back the Imperials from many star systems, and reached a slight military superiority to the heavily-armed Imperial forces.All of this success is threatened by a brilliant military commander, and last of the Imperial Grand Admirals, named Thrawn. For his own reasons, which are inscrutable (he seems to have no respect for the late Emperor and his ""New Order"") to all but himself, he believes the Empire must rise again and the ""Rebellion"" - he steadfastly refuses to call it the New Republic - must be destroyed. To this end, he has found an insane clone of an Old Republic era Jedi Master, Joruus C'baoth, and is using him to perform carefully-planned attacks to drive the Republic to it's knees.What's more, he has agreed to the madman clone's price for his help: Leia Organa Solo and her and Han's twin children she is pregnant with, to be kidnapped and handed over to C'baoth.So began the resurgence in the now truly massive Star Wars franchise. The plot is interesting, but what made this work truly compelling are the characters. Along with the favorites from the movies (such as Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, Lando, so on), you have new characters to enjoy. You find yourself both cheering for and against the bad guys, for instance. This is because, though Thrawn is more polished and refined than the Emperor and Vader, is a genius to boot, and has some good motives for some of his actions, there is little doubt that he is still evil. After all, he is fine with killing incompetent subordinates, kidnapping innocents and handing them over to a homicidal maniac, among other lovely things. There is also no doubt that, though insane, C'baoth is the every bit the clone of his template, one of the more powerful pre-Empire Jedi. All in all, this is quite a challenge for the heroes.Part of the difficulty for the good guys is that Thrawn is careful and smart. He analyzes his enemies, unlike the Emperor and Vader he will retreat from a fight he can't win, and he plans his strategies so that, even when he does lose, he still either gets something, hurts the Republic, or both.One area that Zahn deserves both praise and some slight critique (but mostly praise) is in the area of how ""hard"" his SW books are. In science-fiction circles, there is a scale of ""hardness"" and ""softness"" in regards to the genre. For instance, how much does the story adhere to scientific fact (hard), or just use science jargon or vague ideas to give a template or justification for story elements (soft). Zahn was limited in how much ""hardness"" he could put in the Star Wars books due to the fantastical nature of the series. He still tried. Sometimes this could pull you out of the fantastical elements due to the explanations, which obviously was not a good thing. All in all, this is a tiny criticism, because his keeping the characters grounded made the story more compelling and believable than the truly ridiculous paths many other authors have taken stories down since then. While he is a bit long on explanations and science at times, his grounded approach really has been shown to be for the best.This novel also introduced three characters that would go on to influence future books, and be wildly popular with fans, despite not appearing in any of the films. Said characters are Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Imperial Captain Gilad Pellaeon. It's a testament to the story-telling and world-building skills of Tim Zahn that he was able to create characters that consistently are fan-favorites, even sometimes over movie characters.Of course, this edition of Heir being annotated offers added goodies. As I already stated, there are numerous notes from Zahn and Mitchell about the process of writing the trilogy. These tidbits open a window to the reader about how the tales developed, including what ideas were accepted, rejected, or fine-tuned by the folks at Lucasfilm. To get into the heads of Zahn and Mitchell in some ways helped to almost complete the book, as some questions fans have had about Heir and the rest of The Thrawn Trilogy are answered in the notes.For the Star Wars fan, and really science-fiction fans in general, this is a must-read.Highly Recommended.",5,"US"
2018-02-27,"Kindle and audiobook versions worth the money.","I highly recommend reading along with the audiobooks in this series.  It’s definitely a series that is enhanced with the sweeping music of John Williams rounding out the movie in your mind.",5,"US"
2014-05-15,"Great trilogy","This trilogy is one of the best of the Extended Universe. I almost wish they were making Episodes 7-9 about these books, but it'll be nice to get a new story too. The writing is suspenseful, classic Star Wars action, and introduces or develops a lot of major EU characters. I first read these when I was half my current age, and the talk about new Star Wars movies got me interested in re-reading them. Long story short, I could not put these books down for a few days and my work suffered :/. So don't start reading this unless you have no responsibilities for a few days.",5,"US"
2011-09-21,"FINALLY!!!","I ordered this back in August and was given a projected delivery date of September 12th.  I finally received it on September 20th.  However, I must say it was worth the wait.  The dust cover is gorgeous, the book front and back is a fabulous rendition of the original cover of 20 years ago!  I have not read the novel yet but did read all of the annotations and forward, afterward, and introductory comments and they all increased my longing to reread the story itself which I have not done for sometime.  I hope that they commission a special edition for the other two books in the trilogy for their 20th!",5,"US"
2000-07-14,"Leaves You Wanting More","The audio adaptation of this book is quite well done.  Denis Lawson (Wedge Antilles) does a credible job with the characterizations, well enough for the listener to keep the various characters straight.  His voice does not  drone (important while driving)!  Timothy Zahn has woven a terrific tale of  the newly re-founded Republic and their struggle to survive the remnant of  the now beaten Empire.  Or is it beat?  Admiral Thrawn is simply amazing  (it is difficult to write about someone as being intelligent and actually  having him be that way).  I can add little more to the publisher's notes on  the story.  The audio and special effects are crisp and clear.  Run time:  180 minutes.  Well worth the purchase price!",5,"US"
2016-09-06,"The Thrawn series adds on to an already great Star Wars story","I love the Thrawn series. I read through all of Timothy Zahn's books in high school, and decided after 10 years that I wanted to read through them again.If you're a Star Wars fan, you're going to love these books and even the next Hand of Thrawn series that picks up where these leave off.",5,"US"
1999-06-21,"A good book to start a series","Ifound GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN to be very convining admiral of a imperial fleet, that's trying to take revenge on the NEW REPUBLIC. HIS tactic's are kept to himself as to his aproach to defeating his opponent, until it is  necessary to explain himself to CAPTAIN PELLAEON. As for CAPTAIN PELLAEON i  found his position to be intersting in trying to understand his admiral's  tactic's in subverting the republic. Luke seems to be more mature and wiser  in his dealing with other people in the story. Han and Leia have a good  part in the story in that they have individual stories in the latter part  in the book. I found TALON KARRDE to be a good indiction to the STAR WAR'S  story and MARA JADE to be a little annoying about having lost her evil  emperor and not having found luke all those year's. At times the story  get's kind of slow in different areas of the book but overall it's a good  start in a three book series.",4,"US"

2014-09-20,"By far the best EU novels","If you are at all interested in the Star Wars expanded universe (deprecated now, but still...) Tim Zahn's Thrawn trilogy is the best read by quite some margin. Having a worthy villain in Grand Admiral Thrawn and capturing the sense of adventure and peril of the original trilogy truly a elevates these books.Heir to the Empire pulls off the deft trick of both reintroducing us to the characters we know 5 years after Return of the Jedi and getting the plot moving on this new trilogy in short order.Would HIGHLY recommend it.",5,"US"
2016-09-17,"First Star Wars novel ever read for me","As someone who saw the original ""Star Wars"" in the theatres back when movies cost $1 and has never read any of the Star Wars books, this was immensely enjoyable.It was only after seeing ""The Force Awakens"" with my children who are about the same age as I was when I saw it that I realized I probably should start reading up on the history after the Death Star goes boom.I also was an avid player of Star Wars: The Old Republic (SWTOR) MMO and that gave me even more lore to digest as that happened several thousand years before Vader and Luke. (I actually played a real Sith and Chiss!)I bought the three pack and am now reading the second book.It's highly recommended from a long time fan of the universe and the perfect book to help get caught up for all the new movies to come.",5,"US"
2013-07-28,"First read this when I was a teenager, now, 20 years later, it is still pretty good!","I first read this in the early 90s when I was a teen, and thought it was an incredible book.  Now, 20 years later, it is still pretty good, but not great.  The character's feel like the characters from the movies, but at times it seems contrived how they are always right where the big villains plans are, and they sometimes seem to thwart it too easily.  Still, it was a lot of fun to read, and I will be getting the second book in the series on my Kindle very soon.",4,"US"
2013-03-31,"The best of the expanded universe.  If only all the rest were as good.","Strongly recommended.  Zahn's writing captures the feel of the movies and Star Wars universe. This was the Star Was expanded universe before Lucas let it run amuck with ever growing numbers of basically lousy writing and poorly thought-out continuations.  You feel these stories fit well and would have made excellent movies.  You don't have over-the-top characters like the Vong or million ship mega battles that simply feel like cop-out rather than well considered Star Wars scenarios.",5,"US"
2014-01-05,"Great storytelling with the Star Wars flavor!","First book a trilogy, the entire set tells weaves a mighty fibe story throughou the three books. Zahn has done a superb job on this story. It's adventuresome, fun, filled with well fleshed-out charcters, and vey intelligent. Never dull and nicely paced I found i hard to put down. Didn't want the books to come to an end.Space battles, new and powerful enemies, intrigue in the New Republic government and old grudges to be settled. All the gang is here and they're very entertaining!",5,"US"
2018-05-12,"The commentary is great too. I was worried it would take away ...","Striking dust jacket.  The commentary is great too.  I was worried it would take away from the book, but it really does add a lot considering the place this book occupies in the history of Star Wars.",5,"US"
2018-07-12,"... novel ever"" - but it's part of arguably the best star wars trilogy ever","It's not ""greatest novel ever"" - but it's part of arguably the best star wars trilogy ever, from that time where the EU was still canon and Kevin Anderson hadn't screwed it all up yet.",4,"US"
2015-01-01,"Like many other folks","Like many other folks, Heir to the Empire jumpstarted my re-entry in Star Wars. This footnoted re-release adds a great behind-the-scenes layer, the textual equivalent of a DVD commentary track. Heck, if the 30th anniversary added illustrations, I'd hold onto it as a read-aloud book for me and my kids. (Hmm, maybe I should snag the Dark Horse comics adaptation and cobble together my own.)",5,"US"
2014-05-25,"What I Want In Star Wars","Heir to the Empire is great Star Wars literature. It feels similar to A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, but I actually like this more. The characters are dynamic, the dialogue is all well-done, the settings are spectacular and the plot is distinctly dark. That is what I want in Star Wars. Although I am not a big fan of A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi, I can definitely get into this.",5,"US"
2014-09-16,"The thrawn trilogy is the best spot to start in the Star Wars EU in ...","The thrawn trilogy is the best spot to start in the Star Wars EU in my opinion. It takes place immediately after the events of ""return of the Jedi"" and has all the same characters plus a whole new crew as well. It's a very smooth read with characters that all had depth and personality. Brilliantly written, it should have been made into a movie. Lots of unexpected moments. Must read, you'll be hooked.",5,"US"
2011-09-14,"The best Star Wars expanded universe book","Since I just added it to my Wish List, I cannot comment on whether this new edition is worth buying for those who already have the original book. But I definitely can say that if you have not, BUY IT NOW and READ IT. Heir (and the following 2 books from the Thrawn Trilogy) are easily the best books ever from the Star Wars expanded universe.In fact, I do believe that if George Lucas ever did the chapters 7-9 (which he mentioned once he would not due to matters of his and the original actors ages), they would be these 3 books. And what movies would they be...The books are much more like the original trilogy in how they flow than the prequel trilogy. The pace, the character building, the plots, the twists, the duels, the new additions to the story, all of them take their time to happen, instead of the frantic nature of the prequel movies (and most current movies btw). So magic can be built and appreciated on the reader's mind. Nothing seems irrelevant in the story, nevertheless the story is quite detailed and complex. And yet, it's not a complex reading.Instead of the master-apprentice domination-or-betrayal relationship between the Emperor and Vader, we have the master cunning strategist Imperial Admiral Thrawn (a Spock-lookalike version of German Otto von Bismarck) coming back from the Outer Rims just to find out that his Empire was defeated by the rebels. But he finds and enters an allegiance with long lost Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth (which could be described as a Sith version of Lord Of The Rings Saruman). Thrawn plays his battle tactics like a chess master and always seems to be two steps ahead of the former rebels. And his plans involve a new creature called ysalamiri, that despite the awful name are unique animals whose abilities will permeate the whole trilogy and affect many of the action in the book. On his side, C'baoth wants the future children of Han and Leia to be his apprentices.Luke still has ways to go on his path to become a Jedi Master and sees in C'baoth the opportunity to learn from a Master. But he is also confronted with Mara Jade,a skilled red haired bounty hunter with previous associations with the Empire on her path to revenge. And related to all that, we are introduced to the delicious characters of Talon Karrde, a more tactful Han Solo-like smuggler and pragmatic decision maker whose allegiances are always on the move, and of the Noghri, a species that seem to be a kind of blend between the Ewoks and Bobba Fett.Finally, we have another Lando Calrisian mining adventure on a weird planet, several Rogue Squadron battles like in Episode 4 and 6, some quality time spent at Chewbacca's planet (forget the prequels...) and Leia is learning her ways in the force, although she works as a politician in Coruscant.In a nutshell, Star Wars as it should be.Besides the Heir Trilogy, I believe that the best Star Wars books are the books between Episode 6 and The Heir trilogy, the first X-Wing books, and some of the Yuuzhan Vong stories (not all of them unfortunately, the series started well, but then it went on a roller coaster succession of ups and downs, ending up lost in itself).",5,"US"
2013-01-26,"Well, George, you can shove Jar-Jar up your Sarlacc Pit!","For all of us who had to be removed from the prequels' exhibition sessions straight to the ER, throwing our guts up, THIS IS REAL STAR WARS!!Thank you mr Zahn for this amazing piece of the Star Wars Universe. If only George Lucas had done anything slightly similar, INSTEAD OF RUINING THE FRANCHISE WITH 3 HORRIBLE MOVIES, the fans would be in for a treat...Compelling characters, great storytelling... There isn't enough praise for this novel!GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN!",5,"US"
