2017-01-09,"a well-written Star Wars novel","This was the first novel of the Star Wars Extended Universe, as constituted official canon while George Lucas owned Lucasfilm. It was published in 1991, and forms the first entry in a three-part saga (followed by Star Wars - Volume 2: Dark Force Rising and The Last Command: Book 3 (Star Wars Thrawn trilogy). The story follows on from the events of the original trilogy of films, and is set a few years after the victory of the rebels as seen in Return of the Jedi. The story focuses on the building of a New Republic while the remnants of the defeated Empire conspire to once again demonstrate a show of strength ... and, in so doing, we witness a powerful Luke Skywalker and a new villain, Grand Admiral Thrawn.If you're a fan of the original trilogy and you fancy reading a series of novels set in the Star Wars universe then I recommend this book and the others in the series. It now stands as an alternative post-ROTJ saga, distinct from the new canon created by Disney and the Force Awakens film. This is a well-written novel.",4,"UK"
2016-03-11,"This trilogy is a must read for every Star Wars fan!","Timothy Zahn is a great writer and storyteller! I have read all three volumes of this trilogy for several times in last 15 years. I'm a great fan of the original Star Wars. I could not stand the new ones... You know, Jar Jar Binks and stuff... This Zahn's trilogy should be the next Star Wars movies. This book introduces great characters, mainly Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn... I don't want to spoil this trilogy but if you're into Star Wars, this trilogy is a must read!",5,"UK"

2018-08-09,"The book that started it all.......","The book that started a brand new era in Star Wars history. In the early 90s when the demand was all time low for any kind of Star Wars publications Mr. Zahn created this wonderful book that spawned 2 sequels. Wonderful characterizations, new worlds, new villains (my opinion the best villain in the whole SW universe Grand Admiral Thrawn) , new challenges. After last year's terrible fiasco (The last Jedi), I decided to re-read this wonderful story. Let me tell you, it is still one of the best stories out there. Far better than the horrible plots Disney created in the last couple of years and tried to shove down our throat. It's a pity noone saw any chance to adapt this story for the silver screen. In my opinion this is the official episode 7. Too bad poor Carrie Fisher couldn't make another movie. This would be a great tribute (although I know the story starts 5 years after Return of the Jedi and in the real world 35 years passed away) so this story can live on forever in every hard core Star Wars fans memory as the only continuation of the original Star Wars trilogy. Long may live the author and let him create many more stories like this. I think only a few authors can create stories that are authentic enough to be called Star Wars stories. Mr. Zahn is definitely one of them.",5,"UK"

2013-02-26,"A great introduction to the Star Wars Universe","This was my first dip into the Expanded Universe and, while I've read a number of the books since, this is very much the standard that the others have to match.  For those who are not well versed in the Expanded Universe, this book catches up with the heroes post Return of the Jedi, albeit several years past the events of the movie, and also introduces characters that will be an integral part of the Universe in future books.Zahn's writing style is easy to digest, and his ability to build on the characters only glimpsed in the movies and the worlds we once visited wants you leaving more.  It is easy to understand why the Thrawn trilogy is held in such high regards by fans.  This certainly isn't one for just hardcore fans, if you enjoy reading sci-fi and have a working knowledge of Star Wars, and in particular the original trilogy (eps IV to VI) then I recommend this book.One final thing to note.  With Disney's recent acquisition of the Star Wars brand and the announcement of another movie to follow the continuity of Return of the Jedi, while it doesn't necessarily mean that they will follow the canon of the Expanded Universe, this book (and the trilogy as a whole) will help get you back in the Star Wars groove, and may even help give some context to any characters they may or may not use in the films.",5,"UK"
2017-05-28,"Engaging stories line, would made for great films","I have read a few Star Wars books and I must say this is one of the best stories and part 2 and 3 in Thrawn series are just as enjoyable to read, engaging page turners. these book would make great films",5,"UK"

2012-01-22,"Great start for the expanded universe","The book takes place five years after the events of Return of the Jedi. Grand Admiral Thrawn, one of the Emperor's finest commanders, takes charge of what remains of the Imperial forces in order to lead an attack against the New Republic.The great aspect of this book is it introduces some new characters that are every bit as well shaped as the ones we know from the films. Thrawn is a great character - a strategic and tactical mastermind and a charismatic villain to boot. His method is one of cold calculation rather than rage and emotion. Thrawn is the ideal fit for a military commander. Mara Jade and Talon Karrde are also strong additions to the roster.We see the characters we know so well from the films and how they have moved on with their lives. It is reassuring for this Star Wars fan - a testament to Zahn's skill and knowledge of his source - to see them presented so well. Luke Skywalker is getting used to his role not as the last of the Jedi, but the first of a new generation. Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo married and are expecting twins. Han is all that we have come to expect - charming, living on his luck and a heart of gold.The characterisation drives the story and, arguably, the Thrawn trilogy (alongside the Yuuzhan Vong war in the New Jedi Order series) presents the best material for a new Star Wars series of films/animated series. There is enough action in the book to satisfy those looking for adventure, though of course, the book sets the scene for events in the following two books.The 20th Anniversary Edition contains notes from the author on the text. These are inserted in the side margins of the page. Whilst some are interesting, most are bits of trivia. I was ambivalent about most of these entries, but they are a nice touch.If I was to nitpick, then I would have preferred that the author's notes be presented as footnotes; that way, the main text could go across more of the width of the page. If you stop to read all the notes in the side margins, there is a risk that you lose the flow of the narrative.For Star Wars fans, this review is moot; you probably have a copy of this already. If you have not yet got round to getting a copy, then this is an essential purchase. For non-Star Wars fans, I recommend this as an ideal introduction to the Star Wars universe. The book takes what was great about the original trilogy - character, adventure and heart - and develops on them.",5,"UK"
2017-02-15,"Heir to the Empire reintroduces us to our favourite classic Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker","Heir to the Empire reintroduces us to our favourite classic Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia in what is, in book terms, the trilogy that was to follow on from the original trilogy after the events of Return of the Jedi.Grand Admiral Thrawn is a sinister admiral in charge of what remains of the Empire, and uses his intelligence and incredible insight to know what his targets are thinking at any given time. His humanoid form and glittering red eyes help add that menace that we need in a Star Wars villain. He even has a way of dealing with opponents who have the Force, which makes him an enemy to reckon with. In the aftermath of the Empire’s defeat, the New Republic is already being divided by ambitious politicians seeking power. Leia has suffered assassination attempts by strange aliens, Luke is being hunted by a fiery tempered bounty hunter, and Han is just the same old Han.The author had the character expressions and voices spot on: ‘Threepio’s attempts to be simultaneously helpful, inquisitive, and polite never quite came off. Not without looking vaguely comical anyway.’ The action scenes were brief and thrilling without too much backstory or complex terms.There were a few references to events in the original trilogy and some scenes were a little too reminiscent of events in the film, but at least it showed that the research had been done properly and it gave the book an authentic feeling of belonging to the original trilogy, which I can’t say for certain with the prequel trilogy following The Phantom Menace. In fact, I suspect some ideas in The Phantom Menace had been borrowed from Heir to the Empire, such as Leia giving birth to twins and a sentence spoken later in the story ‘to you and your Republic we owe a life debt’.I would definitely read the sequel Dark Force Rising, and recommend others looking for Star Wars books to dive into this one. It’s authentic and very good.",4,"UK"

Wow, this purchase was definitely one worth making! Timothy Zahn does an incredible job of immersing the reader within the world many of us have come to love so dearly.

For that we should be thankful.However that does not change the fact that this book is needlessly wordy without a whole lot happening, the characthers are flat and dull and the dialogue is.. not well written, to say the least.This book is now outclassed by a large selection of EU novels that can actually get to the point.Worth rembering as a footnote in Star Wars history, but nothing too special.If someone like Matt Stover had got here first, he'd be the one everyone would look to, and we would have a much better read",2,"UK"

2018-04-03,"I doubted the new characters so avoided this book, don't make the same mistake!","Fantastic read - I had always seen great reviews about this book but never committed myself to reading it, but after watching The Last Jedi I began hunting through Star Wars novels for a read and discovered I had a copy of Heir to the Empire. I dived right it and must admit this is the best Star Wars read I have found. The new characters have fantastic back stories and fit into the story line well, they are not far fetched and plucked out of know where. Their existence is justified and with significant meaning to the Star Wars storyMy usual Star Wars reads consist of more well known characters from the movies - novels like Tarkin, Darth Maul Shadow Hunter and The Dark Trilogy. However from now on I will be reading more EU literature - as soon as I have read the last in the Thrawn trilogy that is.",5,"UK"
2010-10-11,"A great continuation from the original trilogy","So I wanted to try another Star Wars novel after reading and enjoying Death Troopers last year. The question was - where to start? There are plenty of Star Wars Expanded Universe books out there, with more and more being released at present. However, I wanted something that would really only need me to have watched the films, at which point I stumbled across the Thrawn trilogy by Timothy Zahn. It's set 5 years after the end of the original trilogy and picks up with the characters I know from the films - all leading to me deciding that it was the way to go. Of course, while looking around I discovered that it's a series of Star Wars books that is rated very highly indeed. So, off I went to see what Heir to the Empire held in store...As mentioned, I'm not someone that is overly familiar with the Star Wars universe outside the main films, so before starting Heir to the Empire I did question whether or not I'd be lost with any additional things that had been raised within the setting since the films. Fortunately this is one of the strong points about Heir to the Empire - it's perfect for EU virgins like myself!Picking up events 5 years after the original trilogy ended we join Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo & Chewbacca as they are part of the New Republic and trying to build upon the chaos that was thrown up when the Empire was defeated. Living on Coruscant they are trying to bring in more planets to the New Republic to strengthen it and make it a democratic government for the member planets. Luke is still learning more as a Jedi and is now teaching Leia to build her powers and control over the Force and Han and Leia are married with Leia pregnant expecting twins, Leia is doing her part as a senator for the New Republic while Han is trying to build links with smugglers to help out with legit cargo hauls. Suffice to say that events have carried on nicely from the film in a totally believable way with each of the main characters using their strengths to help build the New Republic.However, a new enemy has arrived to take control of the old Imperial fleet - Grand Admiral Trawn. He's the last of the Empires high ranking military people and is a genius in what he does, able to think outside the box and knows his enemies weaknesses. He resides on the Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera, a ship under the command of Captain Pallaeon, and directs the fleet from there in an effort to rebuild the Empire to its former glory and defeat the New Republic. Along the way he makes kidnap attempts on Leia and Luke, and also stumbles across an old Jedi by the name of Joruus C'Baoth who is not quite what meets the eye.Apart from the above mentioned new characters we also have some others thrown into the mix, namely Talon Karrde and Mara Jade. Karrde is a big time smuggler, one of the biggest still operating while Jade is his subordinate, and one with an interesting past that is slowly revealed throughout the story. Thrawn is the main bad guy though, but he's one that is a refreshing change from what I've seen in the films and has a much more controlled manner, able to think about the long term goals and carry them out with efficiency. Pallaeon is there more for us to learn more of Thrawn and show how the old ways are not always still used, but he does do the job very well.While the story is fairly straight forward, there are some very interesting new additions to the universe. The two most important of these are the Emperor's store that is located on a hidden away planet and the other is the revelation of the ysalamiri, a species native to the planet where Karrde is based and one that has a very unique and spectacular ability - their presence nullifies the Force, completely. Both these play a large role in the story and help add a new depth to the universe, allowing Zahn to flex his creative muscles in many ways.Suffice to say that if you're a fan of the original trilogy then this is by far the best way to go to explore what happened after the films. It's got a great story and an interesting antagonist, while Luke, Leia and Han all keep the continuity from the films very nicely. I'm very eager to start on the second of this series and do so looking forward to see where the story takes us. All in all I was very impressed and thoroughly pleased to find a Star Wars story worthy of the first trilogy, not like those prequels Lucas insisted on releasing - this would have been a much better direction to go.",4,"UK"
1999-01-18,"A man deadlier than the emperor has appeared:Admiral Thrawn","Thrawn is an evil genuis who wishes to restore the empire in his image.His captain,Palleon is an equally ruthless man and a very good destroyer  captain. Thrawn, who is one of the 11 Imperial grand admirals can predict  to the letter what his opponents will do. It is important to note that  Thrawn is an alien and to anyone who know of the Empire's anti-alien  policy, you must assume that he is outstanding in order to assume his  position as an Imperial Grand Admiral.  He does this by studying their  species artwork. His overall strategy is to destroy the rebel shipping and  capture rebel ships to use in the small Imperial navy. Another standard  imperial tool is terror. He seeks the help of a mad jedi master to help  communicate between ships and increase coordination during shielded  attacks. My favorite character in this book is Mara Jade, a rougish woman  similar to Han.  If you are to buy this book, I recommend that you buy the  other books in the triology because otherwise you will not be able to  survive the suspense.",5,"UK"
1998-04-15,"Where are the characters?","Interesting.  Slightly too overblown. Do they really need to spend that much time going from place to place to place to place?  Disappointed in the characterizations of our favorites.  Granted George didn't exactly go overboard to create the deepest characters in the universe, but they at least ""breathed"".  Zahn's treatments of Leia, Han and Luke are cursory at best. ( And stop with the movie line quotes already!!!!  In-jokes are fine, but every other paragraph?  New dialog, please.)  The 'droids were stock, and Chewie as well.  Lando alone seemed to live on the pages (and not often enough).  Zahn must like scoundrels - and also must consider Han completely reformed!For the new characters, I found myself most drawn to Talon Kaarde. (another scoundrel)  He, at least, changes and breathes.  He's a man I'd like to get to know better, like Lando was in Empire.  What led to him being a Smuggler King?  Where was he when Jabba fell? Or was he somewhere on Tatooine as well - seemed like everyone else was.  He cares just enough about his people so you can like him and is just ruthless enough so you'll squirm waiting for which way he'll jump.  His conversion to the Rebel's cause was slow enough to be believable, convoluted enough to be interesting and echoed the transition Han Solo made much more swiftly in New Hope.  (as Leia comments in one of these books somewhere)  Of course, I hope he and Mara can make it work - she need's a little happiness now.  Luke is wrong for her and Kaarde's the better man, at least in this series.  Sorry Luke!  (of course, I haven't read any of the other Star Wars books yet, either)  Despite myself, I liked Mara Jade.  You knew she'd turn to the Light in the end, which made her a bit of a puppet, but it was a clever way to resolve her problems.  Always wondered what happened to that hand. . .  Sure, Mara's a smart ass, but she's a very unhappy smart ass.  And George has already firmly established that the Rebels can be funny and the Imperials are always serio!us.Nice to see you again Wedge!  Keep flying.The Grand Admiral's insights through art were interesting and mildly plausible if you also have complete psych. profiles for the entire species as well - not just the artists - - but if you have the psych profile, why look at the art?  I swallowed Thrawn's use of the art ""chosen"" by the Senator as an indicator of actions much more easily.  It was also nice to see a competent bad guy again, someone who actually made you worry and made serious inroads on the New Republic.There's a challenge!While I didn't find these books ""wonderful"" as some of the other reviewers did, I did enjoy them for their glimpse back into George's galaxy.  Not a waste of time or money, but then I bought the series used.",3,"UK"
1996-12-28,"Zahn's Trilogy Not Quite Worthy of the Star Wars Title","Timothy Zahn's books ""Heir to the Empire"", ""Dark ForceRising"", and ""The Last Command"" are good books, don't get me wrong. I just don't think they measure up to the Star Wars mythos. Characterization is poor. All of the characters sound exactly alike. Without the phrases ""said Luke"" or ""Han shouted"", I wouldn't have been able to tell one guy from the other. I found Han saying things that I just couldn't imagine Harrison Ford saying, and it was the same way with Luke, Leia, Lando, etc. Another thing that irked me was the way the characters kept finishing each other's sentences. After three books of this, one may become rather annoyed. Some of the original characters are uninteresting as well. While the plot was fast-paced and entertaining, the reader doesn't get the full Star Wars experience. Zahn should have paid more attention to characters and dialogue.",4,"UK"
1997-04-03,"Sequel to the most favorite science fiction series","The most popular science-fiction still continues, Star WarsHeir To The Empire continues where Return Of The Jedi left off.  Hugo Award winning author Timothy Zahn continues the St ar Wars triolgy with the same force and excitment like the others before.  Heir To The Empire is the first book of a three book cycle of the Star Wars Triolgy, followed by the book entiled Dark Forces Rising and The Last Command. ItÕs been five years after Return Of The Jedi, the destruction of the Death Star, and the defeat of Darth Vader and the Emperor.  But in a distant part of the galaxy, an old Imperial Starfleet exists. Commanded by the Grand Admiral Thrawn, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and the Rebel Alliance are in for another battle.  Princess Leia and Han Solo are married and are expecting Jedi twins.  There is a whole new line of characters such as Captain Pellaeon, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the twins.  But still around are characters such as Han Solo, Leia, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and Lando.  The story is filled with excitement, heroic battles, and the battle between the Force and the Dark side. The story keeps the same unique twist, just like the rest of the Star Wars sequels.  I rate the book an 8.5 because I personally like the first Star Wars stories but keep in mind this is the first of three other stories to come and itÕs the build up for the other stories. Go and check it out... and remember ÒMay the Force be with you.Ó",5,"UK"
1997-07-14,"Incredible!","Heir to the Empire - this book started it all. Frankly, I was nota Star Wars fan until I've read it. I watched movies now andthen, but nothing more than that. I've heard rumors that there isa sequel, something about Jedi twins, but dismissed it as gossip.Then, one day I saw it in the bookstore - so, it wasn't a rumorafter all. I bought it, went home and for a fews days the worldaround me dimmed. I was in SW Universe, the one I've never seebefore.Timothy Zahn performed an incredible deed. He managed to createeven more bright characters and worthy opponents than originalmovies did. One fan gave them short descriptions:""Thrawn - he is totaly cool Pellaeon - pride of the Military, C'baoth - he kicks f**ing a**! Talon Kardde - he's a man's man, Mara - my love in another life, Noghri - I like 'em"".",5,"UK"
2013-03-16,"Great book bad delivery","Firstly, I have nothing against the book but the state it was in when delivered was appalling. The package was wide open with papers cramed in. The book has been bent and I expected better.",2,"UK"
1999-06-06,"Fabulous","People write things like ""Duh, it's a Galactic Republic, so how can Thrawn hurt them by attacking shipyards?""  Dense, maybe?  They're  still technically rebels, they call it the New Republic so the galaxy will  be content, but they don't have as nearly much power as the Old Republic  and Empire (it's even called fragile on the back of the book, and is  continually called fragile on many other novels).  Also, the  ""pathetic"" Empire in this book is supposed to be small.  The  Battle of Endor annihilated most Imperial leaders.  Thrawn works with what  he has, thus ""remnants of the Imperial fleet,"" as stated on the  back cover, too.  Because this is not a movie, Thrawn has to set up a  complex story line that makes you want to read further.  Alas, many  illiterates will have trouble with it, because the movies are by nature  less cerebral than Zahn's novels (but not less exciting). They have to be  or people would think they're just boring films.  The space battles's  excitement depends on your imagination; if you rush through this book, it  will seem confusing, of course.  And no, there aren't fuzzy Ewoks or other  stupid creatures in this book, because Zahn is a serious sci-fi writer.  This is a dark trilogy, comparable to The Empire Strikes Back.  Therefore,  many won't enjoy it.  But don't give it 1 star if you don't understand it,  please.  And that's another point; this is a trilogy, so treat it like one  and read all the books, you'll be more satisfied. P.S. Many planets in the  SW galaxy have only one settlement on them, if you watch the films closely.  Whoever said Zahn's continuation of this fact was stupid is a poor-learned  person.",5,"UK"
1998-12-11,"one of the best sci-fi novels ever","This has to be the best star wars book out there. Zahn captures the action, ezcitment, and mystery of the movies.  1) Sophisticated language makes a good book. It adds that  intellignet feeling to it.  2) The intent, from my perspective, in not  saying what happened to the other Grand Admirals was to allow other authors  the chance to elaborate on that. Personally, I like my novels with that  kind mystery in them  3) I'm 13 years old, 11 when I read the book, and I  understood what ""cocking and eyebrow"" meant. I read that  terminallagy all the time. If you adults can't see the obvious, it's not  Zahn's fault  4) At the Battle of Endor, the EXECUTER was destroyed. Zahn  explains quite clearly how a good deal of the Empire's best and brightest  were on it. He said it was the fast track to premotion, and remember, Vader  was the Emperor's right hand man. He could have gotten anyone he wanted on  his own personal Star Destroyer.  5) In the novels preceding Heir to the  Empire, the Empire suffered defeat after defeat at the Alliance's hands. It  is perfectly pluasible that the Empire didn't have alot of ships.  Heir  to the Empire was an excellent book. Zahn receives applause from not only  me, but the thousands of others who enjoyed his novels. I would suggest  reading the other two novels in this trilogy, and reading the Hand of  Thrawn books.",5,"UK"
1998-06-07,"Possibly the best series of SWs novels","I bought this the moment I first saw it in hardcover. I was stunned and excited, wanting more the moment I turned the final page! ""How can I stand to wait another year,"" I thought to myself. You must Realize that the year was 1991, and we hadn't heard anything from our favorite galaxy far, far away in 8 years! If you're reading it for the first time, let the books move you along at its own pace (didn't Master Yoda say something about patience?). I had to say ""If you read any Star Wars novels...blah, blah, blah,"" because Zahn's final follow-up books begining with Spectre of the Past (I think that's the title), which is also amazing, and the Black Fleet Crisis should increase the pleasure of following our favorite heroes. Read some of Zahn's other works and you'll see that he is an excellent choice to write about the further adventures of Luke Skywalker.",5,"UK"
1998-02-21,"A perfect example of why Zahn is a Hugo winner","I loved this book (and the entire trilogy)! The ""Heir to the Empire"" is the best SW novel I have read and one of the best sci-fi novels I have read in a long time. The characters (both old and new) are well-developed and interesting. Leia, Luke, and Han remained in character. I could hear the actors' voices saying their lines. I don't usually like the villians, but I made an exception in this case. I loved Mara Jade and her interaction with Luke was wonderful. Admiral Thawn was a wonderful adversary. As much as I hated him I also grudgingly respected him. The strategy match between the Alliance and Thawn was engaging. I like seeing competent bad guys. Sometimes the Imperials seem to have left their brain at home. This book is a worthwhile read whether you are a casual fan or a major fan. Also, check out some of Zahn's other books. The author has definite talent.",5,"UK"
1998-04-06,"Good stuff in the Star Wars tradition!","Timothy Zahn's ""Thrawn Trilogy"" is, in my opinion, the best Star Wars fiction available beyond the movies. Zahn is one of the best writers I have come across in some time. His style is excellent. The plots of the books in this trilogy are captivating and interesting, yet not difficult to follow or unreasonable in light of the original trilogy. His characterization of the familiar characters as well as some wonderful new ones is superb: Luke, Leia and Han develop just as we might expect them to be developing five years after ""Return of the Jedi""; the characters talk like we're used to hearing them talk (unlike in some of the other Star Wars novels, where they don't sound at all like themselves); and the new characters fit right into the Star Wars universe as if Lucas had intended to put them in the movies all along. Zahn's themes are interesting and well-developed, fitting well in the context of the themes developed in the movies. In all, I would definitely recommend this book to any Star Wars fan who is looking to expand his or her experience of Star Wars beyond the movies. It is a great trilogy.",5,"UK"
1998-07-18,"A Star Wars story worthy of waiting eight years for!","Timothy Zahn did a great job on this book. With HTTE, Zahn put Star Wars back into the minds of former Star Wars fans that forgot the Trilogy during the '80's. Zahn did a good job of capturing the Star Wars characters' essence into the book. He also made some great new characters. Grand Admiral Thrawn was a great villain. I mean, how can you beat someone who can triple-guess you or tell about you from your art? And Talon Karrde's organization was a good group of characters. Look at Mara Jade. She has been in at least half of the following novels and stories, and the main character in a LucasArts computer game (Mysteries of the Sith). I also liked his talent to describe places or ships. I did think it was a little hard to keep track of where the constantly moving characters were. If you like SF, read this book and the following sequels.",5,"UK"
1996-07-06,"A First for All Star Wars Fans","This is the first book written about the Star Wars universethat went beyond the boundries of George Lucas' imaginaryuniverse.  Few books had been written before Heir to theEmpire, but many followed.  This book was written in trueStar Wars form.  The original characters act as you would expectthem to and the interaction between them and the new charactersis true to the form created by the movies.  While inspiring andcaptivating this book starts us on a whole new Star Wars adventurebeyond the movies.  You can now continue to see what happens to yourfavorite characters and you send your imagination soaringonce again.  Timothy Zahn is the one author, of all those trying tocapture the essence of the Star Wars universe, that can say hehas succeeded.  Read this book.",5,"UK"
1998-01-18,"I LOVE THIS BOOK","This os really a great book especially for all true STAR WARS fans, such as myself.  This book gives you information on some of the movie charachters that you'd only know by reading this book.  This book got me hooked.  I loved this book so much it it was the first in a collection of over 40 STAR WARS books that I have now.  My favorite charachters in this book are Grand Admiral Thrawn, for his incredible military genius and his devistating attacks on the New Republic.  I also like the Noghri death commandos for there deadly fighting style making these 1.3 meter tall aliens one of the most deadly races in the galaxy.  I highly recommend this book and the ones that follow.  Also I urge any one who has any intrest what so ever in STAR WARS to get your hands on any and every book pretaning to the subject.",5,"UK"
1999-06-06,"The one to read first","Set 5 years after Episode VI (ROTJ), but the first  novel sequel to the SW trilogy, Timothy Zahn does a marvelous job at creating a whole new universe  of compelling characters and events.  Interestingly different from the  flash-and-bang movies, Zahn sets up a complex story of twists and turns;  unlike The Phantom Menace, it's hard to tell what's going to happen next.  Anyone who says his style is boring is off-balance.  Thrawn is the real  genius of the Empire; obviously, with a larger fleet, he would have crushed  the New Republic.  I also think Mara Jade, though increasingly annoying  with her hatred of Luke, has a well-written history.  Definitely read all 5  of his books, including his new two-parter.  Then read the graphic novels,  they have great illustrations.  By far one of the top 5 best SW novels.",5,"UK"
1997-07-10,"What is Zahn trying to prove?","Timothy Zahn wanted very badly to prove that heknows Star Wars. He took it to such an extreme that the characters were ludicrously exaggerated,almost like charicatures. He spent so much of his book trying to show off his knowledge, the thought that he was supposed to be writing a good Star Wars novel must have slipped his mind. The characters were so off, I often found myself laughing so hard I couldn't continue reading. I finally finished the book, and when reflecting on the storyline and charaters, I felt so disappointed. Han and Leia are supposed to be in love. They never even see each other. It is made very clear that Leia doesn't care about her unborn children. Luke is supposed to be a Jedi. Jedis are serious, I suppose, but doesn't Luke get to do anything? All he did was sit and whine whenever asked to use his powers. Lando is supposed to be a nice guy. In this book, he acts as if he doesn't even like Luke, Leia, Han, and the rest. This book has a very tiring and predictible pattern: Someone plans an attack. The intended narrowly escapes and flees. Grand Admiral Thrawn somehow figures out exactly what they've done. Grand Admiral Thrawn sends out Noghri to attack again, and the wearying, neverending process begins again. Not to mention, even if Thrawn is quite clever-I find it extremely hard to believe that he can figure out the actions of anyone in an entire culture by briefly studying a few people's art. This book frustrated me to a point where I wanted to hurl it to the floor and rip it to shreds. Maybe the rest of the trilogy won't be quite as bad.",2,"UK"
1999-05-01,"PRETTY GOOD","When I read this book I felt, that I need more (thanx god that there is a sequel :)). This book is just fantastic. It has great story and two new  characters. Grand admiral Thrawn and Dark Jedi C'Baoth. Both are put very  good in the story. I have never asked myself why are they here, how did  they get here, ... without expecting an answer. And I got it. There's only  one thing that I don't like too much: Grand admiral Thrawn is darn smart.  I have no clue, how he guesses all these things. But probably that's just  one of his secret things. Maybe this will be explained in the sequel I'm  just reading. Otherwise there is no other thing that i would find wrong. Or  maybe just a little too much pushing with Leia fighting (damn, she is  pregnant). If you haven't read this book ... read it ... and enjoy it.",5,"UK"
1999-01-03,"Finish what you start.","For those people who only read ""Heir to the Empire"" and decided they didn't like it, continue reading the rest of the trilogy. Only reading  the first book of a trilogy is like only reading 1/3 of a story. One can't  base an opinion of a story only having read a fraction of it. Besides of  those people who reviewed the entire trilogy 93% gave five stars. Those are  good odds.I gave the trilogy four stars. Unfortunatly Mr.Zahn was  unable, or unwilling, to add new 'catch phrases', for lack of a better  term. Example, Han solo would only refer to threepio as ""Golden  rod"" The first time was O.k. but I got tired of it. I'm sure Solo  would have called him ""Threepio"" at least once.  I guess Mr.Zahn  thought it was very amussing but it got anoying.Basically If you like  star wars read it. It is a good trilogy, and very entertaining. The plot is  plausible, and The characters are great.Anyway if you want to  continue the Star Wars saga read the trilogy, The entire trilogy. Give  Mr.Zahn the courtisy to read his complete work.The End.",4,"UK"
1997-08-15,"Heir to a Legacy","Timothy Zahn has been for many years a respected author in the science fiction genre. The Star Wars films have long been regarded as breakthroughs not only in science fiction, but in moviemaking itself. The combination of the two has made an entire trilogy of books, the incredible sequels to the original Star Wars Trilogy. The first book, Heir to the Empire, introduces the cunning Grand Admiral Thrawn, who has united the remnants of the Empire in order to destroy the fledgeling New Republic and re-instate the Empire as the ultimate rulers of the universe. With him, the dark Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth, dangerously mad and plotting to steal the unborn Jedi children of Han Solo and Princess Leia. Could this be a new reign of tyranny? Will the pitiful New Republic survive?",5,"UK"
1999-05-09,"The BEST Star Wars book!","As the whopping 150th reviewer of Timothy Zahn's first installment in this trilogy, I suppose my word doesn't count for much. Regardless, I believe  this trilogy, which essentially rekindled the Star Wars interest in 1991  which we all know has grown into a monolith juggernaut, is the ONLY good  Star Wars literature of the revival period (1991-now). The characters are  the best to come along: Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Joruus C'Baoth, Talon  Kaard. After this trilogy, the SW novels spiraled downward as every loser  who walks by the camera in every SW movie has been the star of three  volumes of mediochre literature. If you are looking for new SW adventures,  ""Heir to the Empire"" and the two sequels are the best way to go.  Already vintage Star Wars!",5,"UK"
1996-12-27,"The best Star Wars saga continuation to date","Zahn has created a continuation like no other. This trilogy is simply the best. The reader will be drawn in by Zahn's amazing story and clever, intriguing characters. If you read only 1 Star Wars book, this is the one.  It will make you read the rest of the trilogy, and leave you hungry for more. The only drawback: where do you go from the top? Every other book in the Star Wars series pales in comparison to this novel. The only exceptions are the novels written by Kevin J. Anderson (The Jedi Academy Trilogy & Darksaber) and The Courtship of Princess Leia. Oh, and Shadows of the Empire is pretty good, as are The Corellian Trilogy (Roger Macbride Allen) and the Black Fleet Trilogy (Michael P. Kube-McDowell). But, they are still not as great as Zahn's books.",5,"UK"
1999-05-29,"Generally weak, overrated.","Compared to some of the other Star Wars books out there (Children of the Jedi, The Courtship of Princess Leia,) Heir to the Empire (and the other  two books of this series) are pretty good.  However, I find this book to be  rather overrated by most people.  For one, the characters that Zahn  introduces are not all that interesting.  The story's main villian (Grand  Admirial Thrawn) is a cool-headed genius who plots and schemes and rarely  makes a mistake, however we are given no real insight into who Thrawn is.  The smuggler boss, Talon Karrde, is similar to Thrawn in that he is also  cool-headed and smart, and basically emotionless.  The worst thing about  this book is undoubtably the dialog.  As has been noted by other reviewers,  Zahn REPEATEDLY uses the same expressions and phrases for all his  characters, under almost all circumstances.  It makes all the dialog sound  the same and sound very uninteresting.  Everybody always doing ""wry  grins"" and saying things wryly and ""squeezing their thumb and  forefinger together"" (whatever that is,) and saying ""Point,""  ""Agreed,"" talking in cool, carefully modulated voices.  It's  stupid and it got on my nerves.  While the overall plot was okay, the  weak characters and dialog really spoil the series.  At times, it's like  you want to know what happens next, getting to the next part is sometimes  painful because of the poor dialog, and somewhat lacking descriptions.  And it really doesn't feel like Star Wars too me.  There is more wallowing  in grey areas than good vs. evil stuff, there is little drama and no color,  and no cool special effects.  A lot of people recommend this as the  first Star Wars book you should read, but I personally don't.  I think the  X-Wing Series is probably the best series out right now.  Although it  doesn't star any of the main characters of the movies, that is part of  what's so great about it... all the characters are new and fresh and are  developed from scratch.",2,"UK"
2018-05-31,"it's better in audio format","I used to have the proper book of this, it's better in audio format, the story is set just after the events of Return of the Jedi, with the remnants of the Empire.",5,"UK"
1998-04-09,"Facinating ,the best,and action packed!!!","You looking for a good book.You downright bored.well boy do I have a book for you.Heir to the Empire is simply the best. It's full of action.There's some brearh taking space fights. There's also some really great ground action. The plot is very interesting Grand Admiral  Thrawn has somes plan for domination that will take your breath away. He has found a dark jedi, hidden in the depths of the star wars galaxy and is using him to his bidden while contoling him with ysalmiri creatures that block out the force from Jedi's. You can't even tell  how this trilogy will go or end by just reading this first book. I'm on the second one right now and when I'm done with that I'll have another reveiw for you.But hey this is a must read and I don't want to spoil anymore of it hope  you enjoy it as much as I have.",5,"UK"
1998-12-23,"Almost","The story was great, it was just what I wanted from a Star Wars story. But as I came to think about it later on, it occured to me that this story  wouldn't have been so appealing without the ""Star Wars""-logo in  the cover. And the characters of course. Also, Zahn has a habit of  repeating those old phrases from the movies like Lando or Han Solo saying  'It wasn't my fault!' etc. I know it sounds a bit weird but it really  ticked me off while reading it. I mean, surely the writer can make out  these so called 'flying frases' himself. I enjoyed description on Kashyyk,  the Wookie-planet. More of that and less refrences to the original movies  and it would have been perfect.",4,"UK"
2006-08-24,"a worthy start to the expanded universe","This book kick-started the star wars expanded universe novels, and was one of many that shot straight to the new york times bestselling lists. The story is is quite gripping and makes you want to read further and further, until you realise that the book is finshed!! ( and its only been one day since u purchased the book!)Tim Zahn is at the top of his game here, he manages to descibes locations and characters exactly as we know them from the movies and have come to love. Furthermore a number of legendary and pivotal characters are introduced that make appearences in later novels such as , mara jade, talon karde, captain palleon, the noghri species etc. And Not to mention Grand admiral Thrawn a Villain worthy of being put in the league of the emperor or darth vader themselves.Overall, this is a great way to start of, if you are new to these novels and if you are not, then what have you been waiting for?!? BUY AND READ THIS BOOK!!",5,"UK"
1998-11-13,"Read the Book","Let me begin by saying that most fans, perhaps not the loudest fans, but most fans of good Star Wars and good Sci-Fi will love this book. This being  said, let me also say that in reading this book you should not expect any  logic, for recognize that it is in fact Star Wars, and thus the physics  make no sense. (Yes, I realize that this is not a good explanation, but it  is true.) This book, more so than any Star Wars book save maybe the X-Wing  books, continues in the style of the movies, with a diversity of characters  from smugglers to Imperial captains, and epic battles  against the Empire.  Thrawn truly captures the spirit of Star Wars better than any other.",5,"UK"
1999-01-28,"The Best Sequels","I know George Lucas said a few weeks back he does not want to make Star Wars Episode VII-IX, but with the Hand of Thrawn Trilogy, he doesn't need  to.  These are the definitive sequels to the series.  The rest of the books  are just the same plots recyclyed over and over, again and again, but these  books are the ones that started the entire Star Wars book movement.  Grand  Admiral Thrawn is an awesome villan and the characters are very like how  they were in the films.  Much closue and conclusions are drawn here too,  since Return of the Jedi ended a little quickly in the minds of some.  All  out, this is an awesome book.",5,"UK"
1999-08-12,"A very good start off for a trilogy.","Timothy Zahn did a good beginning to a very exciting and adventurous trilogy. The way he introduced a whole new load of thrilling characters was  brilliant. I think he introduced Mara Jade the best. The way he put this  story is breathtaking and the bit when Luke and Mara Jade are in the forest  and how they cope with each other is pretty funny. My favourite characters  are Luke and Han, but I do like Leia and Chewbacca and I was a bit  dissapointed that they didn't seem to get very main parts in this book.  This book I just couldn't bear to put down. It was really exciting when Han  and Luke had just heard Leia's news about Admiral Ackbar and then the end  of the book came. It really wants to make you read the sequel. I would  recommend this book for any Star Wars fanatic.",4,"UK"
1999-12-03,"Without doubt one of the best books ever.","Timothy Zahn is the best writer other than George Lucas to be involved in the starwars universe.  This is the first book in Zahn's Empire trilogy.  He brings in some of the best charracters out of all the star wars novels.  Poeple like Mara Jade(the emporer's private assassin), and Thrawn(A alien  grand admiral, a master tactition who even the emporer thought him to be a  genius.  This is the first book a true starwars fan should pick up afer  seeing the films.

If you like sci-fi -> You wont regret reading it ! If you NEVER saw the movie Star Wars -> Well...",5,"UK"
1998-09-04,"Very good plot","This is the first Star Wars book that I read. I chose it because it's the  first written after the SW movies (I guess) and I think everyone who's  looking for a SW book to read should begin by this one. The plot is very  concise, nothing happens without an explanation. English is not my native  language, so I didn't care too much about the words or expressions the  author used. Some readers complained about that, but for me the more  important is that it was a very good story that kept me insterested from  the first to the last sentence.",5,"UK"
1998-06-04,"True Star Wars","Timothy Zahn is the only Star Wars author that completely captures the feel of the movies. Zahn understands that Star Wars is not simply science fiction. It is space opera. Reading these books, I knew that Zahn had seen the movies as many countless times as I had! I think he understands what George Lucas had in mind for each of the main characters, and his own characters (especialy Mara and Thrawn) were excellently thought out and developed. Thank you, Mr. Zahn, for continuing the magnificent tradition of the trilogy.",5,"UK"

1998-08-01,"A great read!","To disspell some myths about this book: 1) If the sophisticated language is to much for you, well then that says something about you...2) Every Imperial officer did not die at Endor, Thrawn and Pellaeon to name a few.3) Thrawn did almost beat the Rebellion, thats why he was a Grand Admiral4) They can ""account"" for the other 12 Grand Admirals by simply checking the Coruscant central computer5) Cocking an eyebrow is giving someone a dirty look, or looking like you are in intense thought.6) Zahn is the best author of any of the Star Wars novels.",5,"UK"
1998-07-09,"Zhan carries on the legacies Lucas began...","Zhan, unlike a good number of the newer writers for the Star Wars series, knows what he's doing.  In comparing this book and Zhan's rendering of the characters, to the over forty other Star Wars novels I've read, I have to say Heir to the Empire to by far one of THE best books in a glorious series of books, worthy of a sixth star. It is well written, well thought out, and the characters are true to themselves, a quality of writing many authors lack, including many of the other Star Wars authors.",5,"UK"
1998-09-20,"This trilogy is awesome whether you love Star Wars or not.","This trilogy was phenomanal.  They are the first trilogy of books written  after the movie.  The antagonist is Grand Admiral Thrawn, a tactical  genious and Joruus C'boath a clone of a jedi master with the master's  powers.  The new protagonist is Mara Jade who originally wants to kill Luke  in the end they become friends.  After reading these books I got really  hooked on Star Wars and now I read all of them.  You kind of have to have  seen the movies to understand these books.",5,"UK"
1999-04-06,"Tim Zahn is a genius.","My book collection started with Kevin Anderson's Jedi Academy, but this trilogy is way better. I've read the whole trilogy four or five times, and  never get bored of it. My collection has topped 40 books and this is still  some of the best reading I have. Tim Zahn's portrayal of the characters  here are superb. Grand Admiral Thrawn is an excellent example.I commend  you, Mr. Zahn, and most of all, George Lucas who started it all. May the  Force be with every one of you.",5,"UK"
1997-03-01,"Zahn's added New Intrigue to a CLASSIC!","It's wonderful!  Zahn has created a storyline that's completely in line with with the original classic.  He has created new characters and worlds that make the story so intriguing that you must read all three novels in the trilogy.  I LOVE the touch of a new Jedimaster and a Grand Admiral genius.  Thrawn is a more than worthy enemy for the New Republic to defeat.  Zahn has actually opened the other half of the universe that wasn't discovered in the original.  It's a MUST READ!",5,"UK"
1999-03-15,"Pretty good, not great.....what's the big deal??","Like I said, pretty good, not great, what's the big deal. I think Luke is growing up, and is treating life much more cautiously, but I wish they  would can that stuff. Where did the Luke we know from the movies go? This  is Luke in some ways, he's the same person when he's not in battle, but  when the battles come up, it's like whoosh, where'd the real Luke go?

The old characters seemed the same although grown and the new characters were interesting.

1999-09-24,"The Force is with you - again","The battle between Good and Evil starts anew.  Timothy Zahn has produced a novel worthy of the Star Wars name.

It's five years after Return of the  Jedi and the Rebel Alliance is still at war with the remnants of the old  Empire.  However, what is left of the Imperial Fleet is now under the  command Admiral Thrawn, tactical genius and all-round bad guy.  Indeed,  Thrawn proves himself to be a worthy replacement for the late Darth Vader -  cool, calm and very, very deadly.  As if that's not enough Han, Luke and  Leia also have to cope with an insane Jedi Master, a race of deadly  Imperial assassins and a New Republic riddled with political in-fighting.  Just one piece of advice - buy all three books at the same time.  The story  moves at such a speed you'll find yourself turning the last page before you  know it.  If you haven't got the next instalment immediately to hand you'll  be left tearing your hair out in frustration.  May the Force be with you!",4,"UK"

1998-02-21,"If you don't like this,then you're crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This book is so cool!!!  Timothy Zahn is the best SW author.  His characters were real & believable. Grand Admiral Thrawn was a brilliant & competent(very)Imperial.  Unlike some of the other bad guys in some other SW books, Thrawn actually has brains-a lot (& knows how to use them).  The hair-breadth escapes were exciting.  Mara Jade is one of the best non-movie characters I have ever read about.",5,"UK"
1999-06-01,"Must read for any Star Wars fan!","Timothy Zahn is perhaps the best Star Wars writer ever. Not only does he perfectly re-create the main characters we all know and love, he somehow  manages to develop very unique enemies that have you sometimes cheering  them on. I love the bad guys in this book. Thrawn is even better than the  Emperor in my opinion. And new good characters like Mara Jade are just  great. You have got to read this book!",5,"UK"

I didn't think it would be that good at first but then I started to read it and it was exciting. I have a friend that thinks they should make it a movie too. He finished it before I did so he told me what happened. It would have been even more exciting if I wouldn't have known the turn-out. If you haven't read it yet, READ IT NOW!",5,"UK"

Not the best book I've ever read, but probably the best Star Wars book there is, which, unfortunately, isn't really saying all that much.If there was one thing that really drove me insane about the book, though, it was the sloppy editing and reuse of phrases.

1998-08-24,"Actually...","1) the language is'nt sophisticated , it's just unrealistic.(i.e bad  charectarization)2)Zahn DID imply that most of the Empire's officers  died at Endor , espically aboard the Executor. That must be an awfully  small ""Empire"".3)Thrawn attacked about five planets , and a  few shipyards. Remember that the New Republic is a GALACTIC  republic.4)Zhan was implying that the Grand Admirals were ""dealt  with"". It would,ve been kinda nice if as in when and  how.5)everybody knows what cocking and eybrow means , that just doesnt  give you an excuse to use five times in every page( other Zhan-isque  language , ""agreed"" , and ""point"" , point.. point..  point. I felt like  I was reading bout a soccer game!)6)no , im afraid  that zhan was'nt the best star wars author. he was only the first (after  Dailey and Smith). and when his books came out we haad little to compare it  with",1,"UK"

The Grand Admiral brings the rebellion to its knees.  A briliantly written book that keeps you on the edge of your seat at every turn.  One of the most exciting Star Wars books ever written. In short it is a story to be counted among the best.",5,"UK"
1999-09-04,"It was really true to the original trilogy.","It was way cool ! The way Thrawn was potrayed was really interesting.  He also had a certain likeness to Darth Maul.  Pallenon was classic, and Luke  was really interesting.  C'Baoth was really twisted but he turned out okay.  And the Noghri were really interesting along with Mara Jade and Talon  Karrade.  I was really fascinated by Thrawn's intuition, and stabibility.  Timithoy Zahns Trilogy fits perfectly with the Star Wars Galaxy.",5,"UK"
1998-01-29,"Am I  the only one who thought this book was awful?","After reading everybody's glowing reviews, I tried this book. It was possibly one of the worst reading experiences of my life. Zahn is now on my list of authors who need their knuckles broken so that they won't write again! His prose is so overwritten, the man doesn't know what ""said"" is used for, and can't leave any noun or verb unmodified. It's TEDIOUS! Also, does every character need sixteen different names all to be used in the same scene? It felt like he was playing a game of, ""Look how grown-up I can sound! Look how many words I know!"" In one scene, Luke and Artoo are the only characters in it for five pages. In the middle of the scene, Zahn writes, ""It's okay, Artoo,"" the Jedi Knight reassured the droid. Well, DUH, Tim, do you think we're stupid enough to not know who is talking and that Luke is a Jedi Knight and that Artoo is a droid? Give us a little credit for intelligence why don't you?",1,"UK"
1998-04-07,"A true work of art","This is one of the truly well written books ever written. My comments are expressed in all of the other positive statements but I would like to say something to the naysayers:GET REAL!

1998-07-27,"Best Star Wars Author To-Date","Heir to the Empire, the Thrawn Trilogy, and the Hand of Thrawn Duology are the greatest books in the Star Wars Series because Timothy Zahn is the only author that can make the characters seeme truly real and bring the magic of the movie ino the bok, which is NOT what I can say for KJA. And Mara Jade is the best character a Star Wars author has created so far.",5,"UK"
1999-05-15,"It is not that great.","Zahn didn't put enough descriptions in the book. He never really describes the settings in the book, and while you are supposed to use your  imagination while reading a book, describing the setting would have made  the action scenes more interesting. I also had a problem with Luke giving  Leia a lightsaber that he made for her. That is clearly not the Jedi way.  She should make her own lightsaber when she is ready. Then, there is the  boring dialogue. Everyone always says ""Point"" and  ""Agreed"". Why?? Can't anyone say, ""You have a point  there"" or ""I agree with you""? I also have a problem with  Ackbar on the New Republic Council. If he is an Admiral, why is he on a  civilian council? I didn't like Zahn's choices of weird names, like  ""ysalamiri"" or the planet ""Bpfassh"" (how do you  pronounce those?), Lando's ""Necr'ygor Omic wine"" and  ""Fey'lya"". Why so many apostrophes? All in all, the book just  isn't that great.",1,"UK"
1999-03-02,"What this book merits in content it looses in lenghth.","A good book, but short and it lacks depth.  One can't help but feel that it's been abridged (i actually do not know whether it has or hasn't).  There are much better sci-fi books on audio out there.  I recommend  Berserker by I think his name is Joel Saberhagen.  I don't know if  Amazon.com has it since I checked it out at the library.  happy listening!",3,"UK"
1997-08-03,"Wonderful trilogy to expand the Star Wars Universe.","The trilogy written by Timothy Zahn gives new life to the Star Wars Universe.  It keeps you wondering about the movements of the characters.  The continuing lingering question of what is ""Delta Source"" is imaginitve.  The only problem with the book is the abrupt ending the put to the series, I thought it should have gone on a little longer.",5,"UK"
1998-01-28,"Timothy Zahn is as close to S.W. as you get without Lucas.","I feel that if you have seen the movies and can't wait for the next Trilogy then you have to revert to reading some books.  Well these are about as close as you are going to get to the original characters and action without actually watching the movies.  Good story, clever settings.  The only complaint would have to be the ending, but it's still ok.",4,"UK"

1999-10-15,"Delve into a chapter of life you'll never forget...","Firstly, for any person who has never read a Star Wars book in their life before, this is quite simply the finest place to start. Timothy Zahn's  bestselling novel brings you back into the Star Wars Universe with a jolt  out of your 'mottled hyperspace' of life with a jolt you'll remeber for the  rest of your life. As soon as familiar faces appear in the mind's eye, you  know that 'Heir' is going somewhere very exciting indeed. Just the thought  of Wedge Antilies trying to look inconspicuous in a shady corner of the Mos  Eisley Cantina tells your that your in good hands. New characters are  placed before our eyes subteley; Talon Karrde, Grand Admiral Thrawn,  Captain Palleon and Mara Jade, to name but a few, and are just as deep and  envolving as our old favourites from episodes 4,5 & 6. Heres the bad  news... finish this spectacular trilogy and you'll soon find that, although  others are superb in their own way, there aren't many other Star Wars  trilogy's, or indeed single or double episodes, that will grab you as much  as the sheer depth and calculated genius that Zahn's have graced us with.

A testament of his abilities as a story teller.",5,"UK"
1999-03-16,"This is the best Star Wars book that I have ever read!","Timothy Zahn has taken George Lucas's Star Wars movies and continued the legacy. In Heir to the Empire you are introduced to all new amazing  characters (Grand Admiral Thrawn and Talon Karrade are my favorites), and  reunited with the old classic ones.

He was a little off-beat, buuuut, usually in Star Wars books there are some tendencies to float off into the oblivion.  Mara Jade is now my hero just because she has spite!",5,"UK"
1999-02-15,"A very unrealistic book","While the Zahn trilogy opened the way for all the star wars craze , I was shocked as to how highly people praised this book. My cheif complaint is  one that has been noted , quite effectively , on this site. Zahn is a very  illogical person. The fact that he treats a whole planet as a small town is  ridicoulous. Han immediatly spotting one of Fey'lia's aids on the first  planet he visits is unrealistic to say the least. Another complaint is that  the best military commanders of all time always draw on facts , data , and  analyze a situation using that material , but Zahn , unfortunately has  Thrawn making wild guesses and states he is a genius , but a better term  would be lucky. this is understandable , since Zahn is only a writer , not  a general or strategist , but he should still be critisized. In my opinion  one of the worst Star Wars series of books. Dave Wolverton , and his more  realistic aproach in storytelling in The Courtship of Princess Liea , is  much more suited to that galaxy far , far away...",1,"UK"
1999-02-18,"Required reading for true Star Wars fans","Zahn is a master at how he weaves wonderful new experiences into the lives of the characters that we know and love.

Grand Admiral Thrawn is a great  nemesis who breathes new life into an empire that is nearly dead.  A great  story!",5,"UK"
1999-05-30,"A really cool book","Its the first book written as a sequel to the movies.  Zahn is the only author who can write Star Wars well.

1998-07-06,"Excellent, Astounding, Zahn captured Lucas' Universe to a T","This book is quite possibly the best work of fiction to come from the Star Wars universe.

1998-01-19,"Great!","This (and the rest of the trilogy) is one of my favorite books!  It's not perfect.  I don't think anyone is out of character.  Luke has matured in the years since the movies.  In fact, sometimes I like Zahn's version of Luke better than the original!",5,"UK"
1997-06-26,"Imperialist fans will die over the plot!","Zahn has engineered a masterpiece.

In Return of the Jedi, I was under the impression that the empire (the emperor, the death star, command ships, etc.) was destroyed.  And now, what the heck?  It's still around?!  For crying out loud- this is  a little far-fetched.There was good action and suspense.  However, this  series is pale in comparison to episodes IV-VI.By the way-- HOW ON EARTH  did the Japanese word 'Katana' [sword] end up ""long, long ago, in a  galaxy far, far away""??!!",2,"UK"

1999-05-30,"Excellant","A good book. The parts with Talon Karrde were a little boring. Mara Jade is not as good a character as people say she is. The action scenes were  good. Read this book before you read any other of the Thrawn Trilogy.",4,"UK"
2005-07-08,"A must read for any true Star Wars fan.","An insight into the star wars universe worthy of a Lucas script.The character of Grand Admiral Thrawn is equal in presence to Darth Vader. Its a shame that the Grand Admiral will never be seen on screen. The supporting cast are just as engadging Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie and Lando are true to there movie characters. With the addition of new excellent charecters Talon Karde, Captain pelleon and Mara Jade this novel really brings a new aspect of the Star Wars universe to life.The book is worth reading just to discover the insight into the relationship between Vader and the Emperor. It also offers a new insight into Chewbacca and the mysterious world of kashyyk.In conclusion if you love Star Wars read this book (although you will need to read the other two books in the trilogy to complete the story).",5,"UK"

The Grand Admiral is supposed to be so smart  that he can figure anything out, even when there is not enough info to come  to his conclusions! Many of the Grand Admirals conclusions are IMPOSSIBLE.  They are more like guesses, but Zahn just writes it off to the Admiral  being a genius. Zahn should take a few classes in Logic and Philosophy.",1,"UK"

The author tried to cover so many  territories that a lot of loopholes were left open.  For instace, he either  forgot or deliberately did not include what happened to C'Baoth after being  brought to Jomark. He dwelt about the cloned Jedi master but dwindled  afterwards. What about the Noghris?  Will they side finally with Leia?  What about Mara?  Has the narrow escape made her change her mind against  her plot against Luke?

2012-10-03,"Disappointing","I love the Star Wars films, and love reading. Why not put them both together and read a Star Wars book? It sounded reasonable enough and this trilogy seemed well regarded.Unfortunately after reading all three, I really cannot see why. The story itself is OK but nothing special. The three books are certainly not epic enough to be placed alongside the films, and could have been compressed into one larger book. The biggest disappointment though is the style of writing. Too many characters have the same mannerisms. I have never heard anyone acknowledge a comment with ""point"" however multiple characters use it the book, just like the number of characters whose ""muscle twitched"" in their cheek. Come on, a bit more variety please. Even Thrawn, the jewel in the crown of the series is really rather ineffective as a character, and also adds little as an asset to the story.Poor writing. If it didn't have Star Wars on the front either they wouldn't get anywhere as highly praised or, those doing the praising need to read more.Average books at best. The sad thing is, if these are so highly regarded in the Star Wars universe, what are the other ones like?",2,"UK"
2001-01-29,"Unimpressive, most unimpressive......","The four things that ruin this book for me are: Zahn's writing style, the ysalamiri, C'Boath and Thrawn.Zahn's writing style is terrible. I read 'Heir to the Empire' but had to listen to the second two parts of this trilogy on audio cassette because I wanted to know what happened but I didn't want the pain of actually having to read the second two parts.The ysalamiri are ridiculous - a sort of kryptonite for the Jedi - as is C'Boath the dark Jedi Master. How come we hadn't heard of these before? They would have been pretty difficult to keep secret. And the way Thrawn can anticipate any bluff or double bluff and never be wrong makes him unbelievable as well. Mara Jade is a good character though.I suggest people read the X-Wing series first which is much better or even 'The Truce at Bakura' which is well written.Don't read this - listen to it on cassette if you want to know what happens - at least it's less painful that way.

2017-07-09,"Older novel, but fantastic story.","I've been reading this novel for the last week and am almost done with it.  I actually didn't know when I bought it that it is an older novel and written in 1991 originally.  The novel is a great read though and takes place shortly after the Battle of Yavin (Return of the Jedi).  Luke continues to discover his force powers and Leia is attempting to begin her own training in the force while pregnant with Han Solo's kids.  Grand Admiral Thrawn is the main Antagonist in the book and having never really read anything about him previously, without spoiling it, I can definitely tell why author Timothy Zahn has stated that he is a challenging character to write, but also his favorite.  Its a great book!  I highly recommend it.",5,"US"
2017-12-26,"The classic that started the EU","Heir to the Empire was Timothy Zahn first Star Wars novel (though not his first work), and started the Expanded Universe off with a rollicking ride of a real Star Wars story. A story that, if it could have been filmed in the 90s, might have sent the Star Wars universe in a very different direction. The Thrawn trilogy in particular were masterworks, fitting in to the universe perfectly with both familiar faces and new ones to add to the story including several that became fan favorites over the next twenty years. And this was literally the book that started it all.If you haven't read it before, or if you're coming back to an old favorite like I did - enjoy it.  This is some of the best writing in Star Wars. In any format, by anyone.",5,"US"
2018-03-21,"The Sequel that Should Have Been","In a whirlwind of disappointing new Star Wars movies a small ray of hope peeks out from the thick cluster of cannon vs non-cannon in the form of the Thrawn series. Heir to the Empire is a true sequel to the original trilogy and has all of the feel of the Star Wars universe while giving the audience a new story with new characters and interesting political intrigue. Thrawn is the most effective villain I'd the pleasure of reading about for an incredibly long time. He has taste, a sense of tactics and strategy, and an understanding of the importance of knowing the enemy.I've already started the next book and am currently kicking myself for not having read this series earlier.",5,"US"
2017-11-08,"A fantastic Star Wars story fans will love to read.","I have been a fan of the Star Wars saga since the first move came out back in the 1970s. I did not begin reading the Star Wars books until about six months ago.  I recently purchased this 404 page (Star Wars Heir to the empire volume 1 by Timothy Zahn) on Amazon for a bargain price and found it to be an exciting and fun read.In this book it is five years after the Rebel Alliance destroyed the Death Star and defeated Darth Vader. Princess Leia and Hans Solo are married and are expecting Jedi twins. Luke has become first in a long line of Jedi Knights.Even though the Death Star was destroyed the dark side is actively organizing itself to again dominate the galaxy.  I never like to give away too much information when reviewing a novel because it may spoil it for the reader; however, if you are a Star Wars fan this is a must read book.Rating: 5 Stars.  Joseph J.

2017-08-19,"Introducing the reader to characters like Talon Karrde","The story that restarted the Star Wars universe, Heir To The Empire was the first expanded universe novel for the Star Wars universe.  Picking up a few years after the events of the Return Of The Jedi film, Timothy Zahn not only played with the existing locations, characters, and stories as created by George Lucas, but fleshed it all out with characters and creatures of his own.  Introducing the reader to characters like Talon Karrde, Mara Jade, and Grand Admiral Thrawn, Zahn peers into many elements of the universe that Lucas didn't get around to.  If you have an interest in Star Wars, this is the starting point for your expanded universe.  all the character breath and act realistically, whether established in the movies, or brand new to the settings, and all the locations are well thought out and introduced in interesting ways.",5,"US"
2017-07-15,"A Wonderful Edition that Every True Fan Must Have","Though a fan might have an original copy of Heir to the Empire, this is worth it in my eyes. It has annotations to parts of the original story that any true fan would enjoy reading along the original text (even re-reading the original text is fun after reading the annotations), and it has a new, additional story that serves as the prequel to Heir to the Empire. The additional story is a novella, which means it is much shorter than the length of a novel, but a true fan would enjoy it nonetheless. I sure did. However, I do want to say that it half way answered why Thrawn left the Empire of the Hand and returned to the Empire among the core worlds. I say this because, though Thrawn defeated Nuso Esva and his cartel, I am not sure why he felt it necessary afterwards to deal with the Rebellion. I suppose he wanted to bring the original Empire into the fold of the new Empire to enlarge the Empire of the Hand, but it doesn't address why. I suppose it might be that he is still preparing for the Yuzhan Vong, but the Empire of the Hand is much larger by several times than the original Empire, and it doesn't have all the smug, arrogant, and biased (partial towards humans only) problems along with it that the original Empire has. Besides that, I wish that Zahn would do anniversary editions for the other two books from the trilogy, too, but that is highly unlikely since it has been some time now.",5,"US"
2018-09-19,"Worth your time","Very good Star Wars story.  It is easy to see why so many people would have wanted Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy to be the basis for Episodes 7-9. The book is fast-paced and interesting, though some events are just a little too convenient to be coincidence.  Maybe the force?---------------I noticed Amazon and Goodreads have a slightly different meanings to their 5-point scale. I thought it was odd to have a different rating for the same book on two different sites, so I came up with my own scale below. For the record, it is fairly close to Amazon's scale, but allows me to be consistent between the two sites.5 - Fantastic. Life-altering. Maybe only 25 in a lifetime.4 - Very good.3 - Worth your time.2 - Not very good.1 - Atrocious.",3,"US"
2014-06-30,"It's OK, but I don't like what they've done with Luke Skywalker","This trilogy picks up 5 years after the events of the movies Return of the Jedi.  The rebellion has evolved into the ""New Republic"" and the ""Empire"" still calls itself ""The Empire"" though it doesn't seem big and powerful enough to justify that name.  The New Republic now has the upper hand, but many areas are still controlled by the Empire.  The war between Rebellion and Empire continues.The Empire is now run by Grand Admiral Thrawn, who is a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Lex Luthor.  Like Holmes, Adm.Thrawn is brilliant at deducing what his opponents going to do next.  Like Lex Luthor, Thrawn has no ability with force, he is neither Jedi nor Sith, so he must rely on his wits and creatures called ""ysalimiri"" (that are like kryptonite to  users of the Force) to fight.The main Star Wars characters all appear in the story on behalf of the New Republic and a few new characters appear, including riot grrrl Mara Jade and a smuggler with confusing motivations named ""Karrde.""  The book reads like a YA novel, which is fine by me as I like YA novels, and the author uses way too many apostrophes.What I don't like about the book (and the next one - I haven't finished the trilogy yet) is that Han and Leia are now the main protagonists in the story.  Luke is largely relegated to a sideshow with a half-crazed clone of a jedi master with an unpronounceable name.I think part of the problem with finding a role for Luke is that it's not clear what Jedi are supposed to do.  I've alway wondered what the Jedi ""are""  (Are they galactic police? Are they part of the army?  Are they an independent nation? Are they small-claims court judges (not a  joke - they do that in book 2) ) and I think this is why the first 2 books struggle to find a role for Luke.  Han does all the thinking and gets the best lines, Calrissian does some cool things, Leia is central to the story and Mara Jade gets to be Scrappy-doo, which is better than nothing.  If you're a Luke Skywalker fan you'd be wise to skip this trilogy.",3,"US"
2017-12-09,"An Artifact of ""What Might've Been""","I'm halfway through. Tend to read it on my phone on work breaks. Writing is good, and I know that some books tied into Star Wars can be terribly written. There are some beats that feel off Canon or out of place in Star Wars, like Luke drinking hot chocolate. Though not nearly as bad as the Ewoks TV movies were in this regard. It tends to remind me just how much Star Wars lore got established in the Prequels. For those interested in exploring the ""What might've been"" in Star Wars this is an interesting and entertaining artifact. For those interested in exploring deeper facets of the current continuity in connection to the new film should maybe avoid ""Legends"" titles and stick to releases post 2015.",4,"US"
2018-04-27,"Great read even with it's decanonization","Zahn's first volume in the Thrawn trilogy is for many, myself included, an introduction into the Star Wars expanded universe--now ""Legends"" due to the release of eps. VII & VIII as well as Rebels, etc. However, Heir to the Empire is a great read. We pick up with our beloved trip from the original trilogy a few years after the Battle for Endor. Luke wrestles with what it means to be a Jedi. Hand tries to find his place as an ex-smuggler, ex-general, and soon-to-be father. Leia continues to fight for what she believes in as a peacemaker amongst the New Republic's various factions, all while escaping plots against her life and carrying twins.Grand Admiral Thrawn attempts to pick up the pieces of the Empire. Thrawn, the Star Wars evil Sherlock, consistently outmaneuvers our heroes in their work.And then: Talon Karrde, the honorable, hospitable smuggler who seeks a different kind of life away from the powers-that-be and yet is drawn into their games anyway.Canon or not, Heir to the the Empire is a worthy entry in the Star Wars universe that will excited readers of all ages.",4,"US"
2013-06-25,"Excellent Star Wars Novel","""Heir to the Empire"" reignited the interest in the Star Wars universe and set the stage for many of the novels that followed.It has been five years since the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of Emperor Paplatine.  The New Republic is struggling to find its way, and the last members of the Empire, led by the cunning Grand Admiral Thrawn, are consolidating the remains of the Imperial fleet and have their sights set on the New Republic.Thrawn has two assets at his disposal; a dark jedi and a new type of cloaking device.  He hopes to unleash the power of the Imperial fleet against the New Republic base on Sluis Van.  But the attack does not go as planned, and soon, the Imperials are forced to flee.  Meanwhile, Admiral Ackbar has been arrested, forcing Han Solo and Luke Skywalker to return to Coruscant.I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Heir to the Empire"".  This book was the one that really got the Star Wars novels going, and author Timothy Zahn has done a masterful job of describing events after the Battle of Endor.  His character development is flawless, as evidenced by the masterful creation of Grand Admiral Thrawn.  Also introduced in ""Heir"" is the brilliant Mara Jade, who, after this book, becomes a regular character in future novels.  Also, the continual development of Luke, Han, and Leia (who's pregnant with twins) is well done.I'm eagerly anticipating reading the other two books in this series.  I've been a fan of Star Wars novels for years, but I had never read the ""Heir to the Empire"" series.  I'm glad I decided to start.  Highly recommended.",5,"US"
2015-04-26,"The annotations are a worthwhile addition","I originally read the hardcover ""Heir to the Empire"" when it was published back in 1991. As a die hard Star Wars fan I remembered thinking Timothy Zahn had really hit the mark carrying forward what George Lucas had created.Recently I decided to start reading for enjoyment again. As a software engineer I've spent way too much time reading nothing but technical books for knowledge growth. Though I enjoy my field I hadn't read for enjoyment for over 15 years. I started reading a Charles Dickens classic but found it surprisingly boring. Not wanting to give up on my decision to start reading for enjoyment I purchased the 20th Anniversary edition of ""Heir to the Empire"" for Kindle. I've been reading it religiously every night and loving every minute of it! It's been so long since I'd originally read it that it's almost like I'm reading it for the first time. The annotations from Zahn and others are enlightening and worthwhile taking the time to read as you go through the book.",5,"US"
2016-07-20,"Good to know the historic stories.","Star wars is a multigenerational classic. Like Shakespeare, it has all the strife, horrors, love, scandals and attractions that draw people in deep; shared and passed on. But, what do we know of Hamlets' formative years? The interactions with others that formed his life?  With these histories  the battle of the Empires of the dark side, we are brought up to speed on the who, what where, when and why of the legends of Star Wars.  Zahn keeps you up at night. He fleshed out what the rare, troubled soul, who doesn't 'get'  the Star Wars 'thing', considers useless minutiae. But, it is stimuli to the grey matter of those of us who know a classic when we see it.",4,"US"
2017-10-07,"One of the Better Star Wars Novels","Read a lot of these Star Wars novels including the new canon books.  And these Thrawn novels had the reputation as being the best of the bunch.  So far, I agree!  This book takes the original characters, and actually does something with them.  Whereas most of these other Star Wars novels do very little with the original characters.  Here, the story continues with the characters we love, and keeps the themes from the orig trig going — Good, Old Fashion, Action Space Operas.  This is the first of the Thrawn Novels, and though not perfect — it delivers a good Star Wars adventure with our favorite Star Wars cast members.",4,"US"
2013-05-31,"Heir to the Franchise","Much has been said about ""Heir to the Empire"" in its 20+ years as a story. I can't help but agree with the positive and amazing statements made by so many. 'Heir' is fun, exciting, original and nostalgic. The characters from the original STAR WARS trilogy are written well, and their advances seem very natural for a story set 5 years after RETURN OF THE JEDI. It wasn't like destroying the Death Star just made everything great for the galaxy- there is political, commercial and personal strife in the New Republic as well as an Empire that just won't give up. A new villain, now iconic in the Expanded Universe, written wonderfully with elitism and menace, presents a threat to our heroes as they struggle to face new challenges and new allies as well.What was also really fun was seeing the way this book, essentially the first EU novel after 1978's ""Splinter of the Mind's Eye"", captured the lingo and feel of STAR WARS with phrases like, ""landing cycle"" for Luke's X-Wing and easily integrated references back to the films. Luke's return to the Dark Side cave on Dagobah and his horrific vision of an alternate, failed assault on Jabba's sail barge is another example of author Timothy Zahn's skill in delving into the feel we already know and then progressing the story.The pacing of the story is quick and full of twists. I found myself greatly enjoying the leaps in prose that kept the energy up. Amid the fast adventure, however, is a deep and calculated evil, rooted in the novel's portrayal of the new Imperial enemy. You can feel the dark and seething plotting and how easily this new baddie would fit within the film series.A romp with something for all of the main characters to do, ""Heir to the Empire"" reinvigorated the STAR WARS franchise in the years leading up to the release of the prequel films. This 20th anniversary release includes annotations reflecting on the development of the story, its connection to other works, and modern looks at ideas that were fresh in 1991. These are insightful and fun, giving a connection to Timothy Zahn along the way that almost feels as if you are sitting with him and reading the story. This is a must-read for STAR WARS fans!",5,"US"
2012-12-01,"The Reign of Thrawn Begins!","REVIEW SUMMARY: Zahn channels the spirit and energy of the original trilogy.MY RATING: 3.5 StarsBRIEF SYNOPSIS: The Emperor and Darth Vader may be dead, the Death Star destroyed, but the war has not yet been won. Struggling under the responsibility of politics and diplomatic duties Luke, Han, and Leia now face a new challenge. On the outskirts of the New Republic a brilliant Grand Admiral is gathering the remnants of the Empire in order to strike at the heart of the Rebels.PROS: Zahn accurately portrays well known characters, the fight against the Empire didn't end with the Ewoks on Endor, Grand Admiral Thrawn is a superb villain, author's notes enhance the experience.CONS: Luke is sort of a sissy, too many cases of coincidence, Mara Jade isn't all she's cracked up to be, Grand Admiral Thrawn might be too smart.BOTTOM LINE: Despite some flaws this is still better than anything offered in Episodes I-III and the 20th Anniversary Edition is a great collector's item.The news of Disney buying Lucasfilm accomplished something that I never would have thought possible. It got me excited about Star Wars again. I used to be a major fan of the series as I think most kids are. My aunt took me to see the original trilogy when the movies were re-released to theaters in the 90's. At the time Taco Bell had promotional Star Wars toys and I also got my first battery-powered lightsaber. It was the Golden Age of my childhood. I continued to love the series well into my teenage years. It wasn't the new trilogy that killed it for me (although that was the start), but the CGI movie, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and the Cartoon Network show it spawned. I hadn't looked back since...that is, until the news of Disney's acquisition.My first reaction was to laugh. Disney! Buying Star Wars! What a joke! And then I realized that I'd had the same reaction when Disney bought Marvel...and look how awesome The Avengers turned out. Then all the speculation started about what would be in store for Episode VII and that is how I came across Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire. And fortunately for me, Zahn's classic had been released in a beautiful 20th Anniversary Edition, complete with a foreword and author's notes. But enough background and onto the review!The Rebels won the Battle of Endor. The Emperor and Darth Vader are dead, the Death Star has been destroyed (again), and the Imperial forces have been routed. Star Wars: Return of the Jedi ends on a high note. Too high a note if you ask me. It would seem as though Timothy Zahn felt the same way when he wrote Heir to the Empire. The battle has been won but the war is far from over. Heir to the Empire picks up five years after we left off. Luke is coming to terms with the loss of his mentors. Leia is pregnant with twins. Han has gone legit. All three are chaffing at the roles they find themselves in within the New Republic. Organizing an effective rebellion isn't the same as building a working government. Politics threaten to tear the New Republic apart and a new threat is rising from Imperial territory. That threat is Grand Admiral Thrawn, a brilliant strategist that has gathered the remnants of the Empire together in order to take back what the Rebels have stolen.First I have to say that the author's notes are an awesome edition to the story. Zahn put an amazing amount of work into Heir to the Empire. The author's notes serve to highlight the special details that might otherwise be glossed over during the read. It turns out that Zahn is responsible for a lot of terms and ideas that most Star Wars fans probably take for granted. This is the man that came up with the legendary Rogue Squadron.Zahn's greatest strength is in translating everyone's favorite movie characters into text. As I read the dialogue I could hear the actors' voices and picture their mannerisms. Zahn is especially deft at writing Han Solo's roguish wit, Lando Calrissian's charm, C-3PO's neurotic twittering, and (surprisingly) R2-D2's beeping and chirping. Han and Lando really steal the show, it is great fun to see them operating as partners. Leia sort of gets shafted with Heir to the Empire, as she spends the majority of the novel running and hiding from Imperial kidnappers. I was also mildly disappointed with Luke Skywalker. When deprived of the Force and his lightsaber Luke loses most of his appeal. Star Wars: Return of the Jedi left a striking image of Luke in his black suit, taking matters into his own hands. That inspiring version of the Jedi Skywalker is not to be found here. I appreciate Zahn touching on Luke's light depression and anxiety but he fails to show him as the heroic figure that he became with the closing of the original trilogy.The star of Heir to the Empire is Zahn's creation, Grand Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn is an amazing villain. He has a military background that is something that separates him from the Emperor and Darth Vader. He commands through loyalty rather than fear, and he understands strategy. What is cool is that Thrawn is not Sith. He has no Force powers. If he is going to defeat the New Republic it will be through sheer force of will and military superiority. Granted, Thrawn's intelligence can get to be grating at times. Thrawn is right 99% of the time. Stories aren't fun if the hero always wins and there is a lack of fun if the villain is always right.Mara Jade is supposed to be another of Zahn's greatest creations, though I'm not yet convinced. From what I understand, she is a favorite among fans. I'm guessing that she gets better in the later novels. I will say that it is nice to have another strong female, especially given that Leia gets swept to the side for most of Heir to the Empire, but Jade's beef with Luke just strikes me as silly. It basically comes down to, ""You ruined my life because I didn't get to kill you at Jabba's Palace so now I hate you and want to kill you."" It definitely doesn't help that once Luke finds out the motivation behind Jade's hatred he is almost apologetic about the fact that he is still alive.The plot is fun but the formula does get repetitive. The all knowing Thrawn sends his lackeys after our heroes, the heroes narrowly escape, the heroes devise a plan to avoid the Imperials, Thrawn almost automatically guesses what the plan is, annnnnd repeat. There is just too much coincidence. I'm willing to accept the guiding influence of the Force in the Star Wars universe but a rose by any other name is still deus ex machina. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back has always been my favorite of the movies because of the darker tone and so Heir to the Empire hits the sweet spot in that department. Heir to the Empire has that same dark flavor as well as some more mature themes relating to the politicking. The action isn't quite what I'd hoped for though the Battle for the Sluis Van shipyards is a great finale to the novel.All in all I enjoyed Heir to the Empire. It truly felt like the sequel Star Wars: Return of the Jedi always deserved. Those that dislike the Ewoks and found the Battle of Endor to end too cleanly will likely agree with this sentiment. I am interested to read more about Grand Admiral Thrawn and I hope to see Mara Jade develop into a better rounded character. I'd also like to see Luke return to his awesome heroic ways. I'd appreciate more of the Han/Lando team-up and maybe Leia will find more of the spotlight. I will be purchasing Star Wars: Dark Force Rising but I think perhaps I'll wait to see if they release a 20th Anniversary Edition of that as well.Nick SharpsSF Signal",4,"US"

2013-08-03,"Yagy Review","This is my all time favorite Star wars book. Definitely to date the best one ever written. Even the other 2 books in the trilogy are amazing.Pros:1: Thrawn. Yes Grand admiral Thrawn, not only a huge fan favorite of myself and countless others but one of the most interesting and awesome additions ever to the Star Wars universe.2: Thrawns Genius. Thrawn unlike most of the other imperials does not let emotions govern his actions. He is cold, calculating and precise. Think of him like Boba Fett, hes like a chess master, always several moves ahead of the New Republic.3: Thrawns obsession with art. This was actually really cool, Thrawn is able to discern the enemies weaknesses and strengths by studying the art of their culture.4: Mara Jade. The second greatest addition to the star wars universe since the lucas movies. Mara Jade once an imperial agent is now trying to live as a smuggler and forget her past when she is caught up in the wave of events that Tim Zahn masterfully unfolds in his story.5: Talon Kardde. Kardde was also pretty awesome, hes the new smuggler chief now that Jabba is out of the picture.6: Captain Pelleon. He is fated to become a great leader. But till then he is an interesting character, the perfect imperial officer if you will, tutoring under Grand admiral Thrawn.7: Nohgri. Its interesting to note that Zahn was going to make them Sith because back then no one knew what a Sith meant. Still the Nohgri are awesome, deadly small nimble assassins.8: Han Solo, Zahn is a master at writing Han Solo and really catches his sarcastic, hard edged smugglers charm.9: Joruus C'baoth. I loved this character so much. He was the first real Dark Jedi Master that we are introduced to in the star wars EU, of course by now there are others that take place in time b4 him, but as far as this being the real first star wars EU novel  C'baoth was just what the force doctor ordered. What also makes him interesting is the mystery surrounding him, is he evil or just insane? You will have to read to find out.10: just about everything in this book is awesome.Cons:1: Ill put it in here though i kinda disagree but ive seen people complain about the coincidence factor, where like the characters keep ending p in the same place at the same time perfectly in time for a major event. If you ask me it makes sense due to the Force manipulating events to be balanced out.2: Pronunciation. IE C'baoth, Thrawn, Nohgri ect. The names are clever but yes very hard to pronounce, especially C'baoth. I asked the author how to say it and it wasnt at all like i thought it would be. It was like Sib ah Ohth. And did you know germans cant pronounce Thrawn?3: Jedi suppression. This part i will agree with, while Luke does do some fun Jedi moves in here it does seem Zahn dislikes writing Jedi and having them use their powers.4: No Boba Fett :( I was bummed not to see Fett or any of the famous hunters. Zahn told me once that he feels Fett is overrated and would most likely not write him. That made me sad, and while he has had fett in a book he wrote (not this trilogy) it still wasnt really the fett we wanted.SummeryThis book is truly a masterpiece despite the few flaws. Its as close to seeing a star wars movie as you can get in novel format. Theres so much more i could say about it but if you want to know what all the hype is about just go read it!!!",5,"US"
2011-10-12,"A worthy heir","I won't spend much time reviewing the actual novel because it's been out for 20 years already and I've reviewed it elsewhere. Rather, I'll just say a few words about the new features in this addition. First, Timothy Zahn provides a lot of footnotes and commentary (over 200 footnotes or so). Some are short reflections on what he wrote, but others provide actually pretty interesting insights into the writing process. He mentions where he left clues of plot twists to come, as well as when he simply hadn't thought through the backstory for certain references (the Outbound Flight being the most prominent and surprising example, given that it alone spawned at least two other novels). Zahn is also candid in pointing out where later EU works and prequel films made his narrative obsolete, although he does try to retcon a few items (still, overall, Zahn's books have suffered relatively little retconning even after 20 years). My favorite comments were those tying Zahn's personal life to the book and the writing process. I thought his defense of using lines from the original trilogy movies was brilliant. Overall, this isn't quite the edited version of the Hobbit, which revolutionizes your reading of the novel, but it's still definitely THE way to read Heir to the Empire and a nice treat for fans. Congratulations, Mr. Zahn!",5,"US"
2016-03-12,"Exciting adventure","I enjoy reading the star wars adventures after the original stories. This is the first of a trilogy that has a fragile New Republic and a fractured Empire trying to keep things together and expand. The empire has a real warlord in Thrawn, who has his eye set on the bigger picture and will do things his way to get Luke and bring back the Empire's glory. Leia, Luke,and Han are trying to keep the New Republic growing and trying to prevent a civil war. It's fast pace and ends making me wanting to get the next two books. I enjoy Timothy Zahn as an author and know it will be a fun exciting read! May the Force be with you!",5,"US"
2011-10-18,"Brilliant","It has been a long time since I've explored the Star Wars universe.  Just recently, I began dabbling again, and Star Wars: Heir to the Empire: The 20th Anniversary Edition (Star Wars (Del Rey)) caught my eye.  Obviously, it's been twenty years, but I missed it the first time around.  It's all new to me, but I'm glad I found it now.  What a thrill it was to read.  Timothy Zahn expertly captured the true spirit of Star Wars, and I was happy to see him let the personalities of each of the main characters remain true.  I could practically see Luke, Leia, Han and even R2-D2 jump right out of the pages.  What skill!  I'd often finish reading a passage and wondered how he did that.This book takes place after Return of the Jedi, with the return of all the main characters and the addition of new ones.  It is the first of a trilogy, so expect a cliffhanger.  I am right there and can't wait to see it to the end.If you are wondering whether to get the 20th Anniversary Edition, I'd say go for it.

2012-04-20,"faithful and deserving of its fame","Timothy Zahn stays faithful to what you would expect from the legacy of Star Wars. The ""regulars"" maintain their key personalities and skills, with no surprises because someone turned to the Dark Side or is suddenly unfamiliar. Zahn stays true to the canon, which is one reason this book became so fundamental to the Expanded Universe post-Lucas. That of course also requires a solid story. Just as animation only succeeds with a first-rate story, a contender for the elite can't simply cruise because of the Star Wars tradition.The introduction of the new characters, particularly Grand Admiral Thrawn, shines more than the story itself, which I'd rate only a ""B"" because of an average ending and less development of a key theme and character than I expected. No doubt such topics will pick up in the other volumes of the trilogy, along with the continued rich character development that would be less likely had Mr. Lucas been in charge.I had to smile a bit in the story line focused on Mara Jade, with her intense hatred for Luke that is somewhat explained later in the novel. Naturally, she's tough and attractive and talented, and their relationship is tense. You just know that there will be more to this down the line. We've all seen too many movies where boy meets girl, they don't get along, and, well, stay tuned.",4,"US"
2015-01-05,"Quite enjoyable :D","I always heard this was an amazing book and never anything negative about it. So I finally got around to reading it and I wasn't disappointed, I enjoyed it a ton. The only real annoying part was I had to go on Google and look up the alien race and such to get a mental image of what on earth the aliens he created looked like, but it's not the end of the world to do that. I wont go into details why this book is amazing and such since for crying out loud... its been out for years, so everyone who knows of it has already read it by now.I took off the dust cover for the heck of it and I really liked how the original cover art is on the cover and black and white, the way it looks is pretty awesome.",5,"US"
2018-01-21,"This trilogy of Zahn's is one of the best of all the Star Wars expanded universe","This trilogy of Zahn's is one of the best of all the Star Wars expanded universe! His mastery of the nuances of each of the characters in his titles is nothing short of astounding.This trilogy is highly recommended!",5,"US"
2017-06-17,"Awesome read in this Canon","This book deserves 5 stars hands down. I was reluctant to go back and start on this Canon of the star wars universe, but I have to say between this and the aftermath series and even the force awakens, I wish this story was on the big screen.",5,"US"
2016-03-24,"An awesome villain in the time line of the original set of movies.","“Heir to the Empire” is set about five years after the first movie trilogy (by release date, i.e. after “Return of the Jedi.”) It features many of the principal heroes of the first trilogy including: Luke, Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, and C-3PO. Obviously, gone are most of the bad guys from the movies, but in their place has risen Grand Admiral Thrawn—a master strategist who seeks to revive the Empire. Thrawn is portrayed more as a brilliant military man than a dastardly villain. This doesn’t mean he can’t be cold and villainous, but he also brings in a measure of intellect and rationality not seen in the movie universe. While it would appear that Luke is the last of the Jedi Knights, or the first of a new line if one prefers, that turns out to be not entirely true.I enjoyed this book. I bought it during a Kindle sale on what Amazon considered to be the best “Star Wars” books.  While I’d seen the movies, I hadn’t read any of ancillary works, and so I Googled to find out which of the books on Amazon’s list were considered by fans to be the best. Zahn’s Thrawn trilogy, and particularly this first installment, seemed to be on every fan’s list.One of the great plot devices used in this book is a creature whose mere presence can nullify the force. This strips Luke’s powers away through a critical piece of the book. Yes, the introduction of this creature is deus ex machina, but it’s deus ex machina that challenges the protagonist--rather than making life easier for him--so it’s alright by me. Because Luke is the last of the known Jedi, he’s essentially a Superman among mere mortals, and so the book might have become tedious if Luke weren’t stripped to his native intellect and courage devoid of superpowers. Instead, he has to escape from the planet on which these creatures reside and help rescue Han and Lando in the process without any supernatural abilities.As mentioned, this is the first book of a trilogy, and, therefore, it leaves many major issues unresolved. Multi-part series usually have less satisfying endings than a stand-alone book, and I can’t say it’s not true of this work. However, this first book of the Thrawn trilogy does contain a clear climax and a definitive tactical (battle-level) resolution.The book intersperses chapters from the hero’s point of view (PoV) with those from the Thrawn’s ship. This book begins with a chapter from the enemy’s PoV, and so for “Star Wars” neophytes—such as myself—one enters into a whole new territory in which it’s not quite certain when or where one is in the “Star Wars” universe. However, in subsequent chapters Luke, Leia, and Han are introduced and we learn that Han and Leia are married and that Leia is pregnant, and this gives one insight into the timeline of the book. We also learn that while the Empire seems to have been destroyed, the Republic is on week footing and is having trouble reestablishing itself.The book introduces us to a couple of new characters that I understand will become established in the expanded “Star Wars” universe. The most intriguing and important of these is Mara Jade, the right hand woman of the most powerful smuggler in the known universe. We soon learn that Mara despises Luke Skywalker and wants nothing more than to dance on his grave. However, we don’t learn until much later why it is that she hates him, and we learn after a time during which the two are forced together by circumstances. Mara Jade is a force to be reckoned with. While she might not be a match for Luke the Jedi, she is more than a match for Luke stripped of his powers. It seems clear that Zahn is building a relationship between Luke and Mara with their interaction in this book. Luke is oblivious to why Mara dislikes him, or even who she is until he is explicitly told, but events force them to spend time together under trying circumstances.All in all, I liked this book. I found it readable, and thought that it did a good job of maintaining tension throughout.",4,"US"
2015-07-18,"Great writing, Great Plot.","This book is great. It feels so much like the original trilogy and is able to expand on the story with relying to heavily on Jedi action like the prequel movies did. It's also refreshing to have a SW story that never involves Tatooine. There is a rich world of characters who are unique and familiar at the same time. Also, great to see the villains not relying on overwhelming strength, but rather tactical intelligence in order to pose a threat.As much as I'm looking forward to Disney's new take on Star Wars, I feel like this is probably a ""truer"" continuation of the Star Wars story I grew up with.",5,"US"
2017-05-07,"Not bad","It's been over twenty years since I first read this. I remember when it originally came out how excited I was to continue the adventures of Luke, Han and Leia. To this day it still doesn't disappoint even though it's not cannon. There are some things I've always logistically disagreed with but as a SW Legend it all makes sense now.A good read for those who are about to dive into Thrawn.",3,"US"
2014-05-22,"Star Wars & Zahn","I've been a big fan of Timothy Zahn for many years which would probably have lead me to read these anyway, never mind them being Star Wars. Starts off a little slow but quickly gets a bit more complicated. I like that there is more to the series than just the straight action, but also gets into the intricacies and complications of political infighting and personal motivations. This is a re-read for me but I'm finding it just as interesting reading it almost 20 years later. I now have a greater appreciation for the subtleties that I didn't truly understand as a young adult. Then I was more concerned with the action than the motivation. If you find the first book too easy, make sure to read the second. As the story unfolds the more the moving pieces begin interacting more with each other and cross paths. Definitely worth the read. I would like to see these Trilogies compiled into one book. Now reading them on a Kindle I see no need to have them separate. It'd also make it easier to keep the sequence of events straight between all the books of the Star Wars series.",4,"US"
2017-09-21,"DUN-DUN-DUN DUH DUUUUHHH","I really enjoyed this entire series.  Thrawn is a brilliantly cunning villain and the characters maintain their original series charm.  No complaints other than that I finished the series and am left wanting more!",5,"US"
2013-01-21,"Will this be the next Star Wars movie?","As a fan of the original three films of the Star Wars canon, I enjoyed the first book of the SW Universe that I have ever read.  This first installment of the 'next trilogy' picks up five years after Return of the Jedi with the gang up to their usual tricks, but now helping to build the New Republic while fighting off the remnants of the Empire.The Kindle version I read included a listing of all of the books in the Official SW Universe, with sample chapters from other eras.  The downside of this was that the book ended at 73%, which was unexpected, but I have already downloaded the next book (Dark Force Rising) to keep the Force flowin'!One quasi-spoiler...I counted three times someone said some variation of ""I've got a bad feeling about this.""  One (maybe two) would have been sufficient for continuity with the canon.",4,"US"

2015-09-11,"Slow pacing but Star Wars esque, no doubt.","It took a long time for me to get into this book.  For awhile I wondered when something interesting would happen.  It never did, but I soon accepted that this book was not going to be as action packed as the prequel trilogy.  Nor was it going to focus at any length on Jedi or Sith angles.  I feel like it took an episode 4 type approach to the storytelling.The good thing about the book is that it felt a lot like episodes 4-6.  It's good to see all the old characters adventuring together again.  Grand Admiral Thrawn is an excellent character but with no connection to the force, light side or dark side, I found his antagonistic role in a Star Wars book to be lacking.  I would rather him be commanded by a Sith figure.All in all, I'm glad this is now officially EU.",3,"US"
2017-05-13,"Great for a fun read, so long as you can tolerate some bad writing habits.","The story is fun and I enjoyed how he wrote the various characters as we have grown to know them as. Han Solo acts like Han Solo. Princess Leia acts like...you get the idea. But Timother Zahn has some bad habits in writing. He uses the word ""just"" too much. It's like a shortcut to what really should be written. He has other writing habits too. These would knock me out of the story, especially when he uses it five times on a page. (Yes, he  does that).I purchased the other two books from a brick and mortar store because I wanted to finish the story. I wasn't disappointed except with Luke's character development. I will leave it at that.There are some story plots that he tends to favor and they received the better writing than the others. I did grow tired of Leia's story and Han and her always seemed to get split up too easily.",3,"US"
2012-07-13,"THE STORY after the saga has ended","While this review is being written in 2012, I read these books when they came out in the time when there was so little in the Star Wars universe. We only had Splinter of the Minds Eye, Han Solo Triology (original) and a Lando tale or two. When I started reading the first of the three, my Star Wars universe was alive once again. Alive with the characters that I come to love and had missed so desperately. New villains and new stories drove my imagination. I could not wait for each subsequent book to be published. And just like the conclusion of Star Wars Ep VI, I was satisfied and sad because the journey was over. IF you love a great story, if you love Star Wars, and if you love great characters - these are the books for you. I truly believe that these books helped bring the Star Wars Universe back and sparked a ton of work that followed that has allowed us to all remain a bit longer in that Galaxy, far, far away. Enjoy",5,"US"
2018-09-08,"Timothy Zahn is the reason why we have Star Wars movies today.","Great read. Great plot. Great licensed characters and even greater new original characters.This trilogy came out when the Star Wars franchise was on the shelf and getting dusty. Almost forgotten by all but one generation.  Timothy Zahn single handedly sparked the imaginations of both the original generation of fans and a new generation who grew up after the original films.Without Timothy Zahn, I doubt George Lucas would have had the spark to pursue the prequel trilogy.  Zahn fertilized the ground for Lucas to return to play in.",5,"US"

I only have one problem with it, and maybe its because I am honestly not a super fan of Star Wars... Grand Admiral Thrawn, and generally all the author's characters, are just so much more interesting than Luke, Leia, and even Han. It's hard to cheer for the ""good guys"" now that they are the big guys, and when the underdog Empire admiral is just so *cool*.Still, would solidly recommend this book.",4,"US"

Timothy Zahn has an eye for detail that escapes most authors of any genre, and has carefully crafted a fantastic story that has something for every reader to enjoy.The trilogy focuses both on the difficulties of setting up a new government to replace the old Empire, the number of things still mysterious and unknown even in a well-known universe, and the artful style with which a true strategist could use the resources of the Star Wars universe.If I could rate it higher than five stars, I would.",5,"US"

Although I was a little disappointed by the sudden ending and some of the context of the book, like the corny one liners, but it's a great read.Unlike the majority of the fan fiction authors, Zahn really brings the characters to life as Lucas originally portrayed them. If this book does indeed become a movie, it will be a real good one.",4,"US"
2002-05-04,"You can see it in your mind's eye!","Darkhorse did a most excellent job on this graphic novel. It is practically a story board for the film- you can SEE it in your mind's eye. As for the story itself, I think it is the best since the original Episode 4. There are so many subplots and plot twists that it is impossible to be bored- combined with the what should be a barrage of special effects and exotic sets, it should be overwhelming.  It isn't all special effects, though. There are some powerful dramatic scenes here. I can see where some of them (like the last stand of the Jedi) may go down in cinematic history. There is also IDEALISM here. It is like George Lucas is winning back the soul of his creation after certain politicians and arms merchants coopted the Star Wars name for their own agenda....",5,"US"
2014-02-26,"The Book That Re-Started the Expanded Universe","After the original Star Wars films ended with the release of Return of the Jedi, the interest in the franchise waned, seeming to end with the cancellation of the Marvel run in 1986. There appeared to be no market anymore for stories set in the galaxy far, far away, but some at Lucasfilm disagreed, so they pitched an idea to their superiors for further Star Wars adventures. They argued that these new adventures should take the form of novels set in the time period after Return of the Jedi.Once they received approval from George Lucas and the other higher-ups, they searched for a writer to pen this new trilogy, and decided to offer the contract for the trilogy to then-rising science-fiction writer Timothy Zahn. Thus, what would become known as The Thrawn Trilogy was born.The first book, Heir to the Empire outsold the modest hopes that had been held out for the books, and much more. It was a run-away best-seller that proved that there was still a HUGE market for SW stories. Timothy Zahn went on to become, for many fans, the definitive author of the EU (Expanded Universe) of SW stories.Twenty years after the initial release of Heir, Timothy Zahn released a special annotated version of the novel, with helpful notes, observations, and explanations from himself and (every once in a while) Betsy Mitchell, his editor at Random House.Of course the story is terrific fun. It takes us five years after the end of Jedi, where the Rebel Alliance has made huge gains since their victory over the Emperor at the Battle of Endor. In those five years, the Rebellion have established a formal government (called the ""New Republic"" as a continuation of the Old Republic Palpatine ended in his Sith plot), pushed back the Imperials from many star systems, and reached a slight military superiority to the heavily-armed Imperial forces.All of this success is threatened by a brilliant military commander, and last of the Imperial Grand Admirals, named Thrawn. For his own reasons, which are inscrutable (he seems to have no respect for the late Emperor and his ""New Order"") to all but himself, he believes the Empire must rise again and the ""Rebellion"" - he steadfastly refuses to call it the New Republic - must be destroyed. To this end, he has found an insane clone of an Old Republic era Jedi Master, Joruus C'baoth, and is using him to perform carefully-planned attacks to drive the Republic to it's knees.What's more, he has agreed to the madman clone's price for his help: Leia Organa Solo and her and Han's twin children she is pregnant with, to be kidnapped and handed over to C'baoth.So began the resurgence in the now truly massive Star Wars franchise. The plot is interesting, but what made this work truly compelling are the characters. Along with the favorites from the movies (such as Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, Lando, so on), you have new characters to enjoy. You find yourself both cheering for and against the bad guys, for instance. This is because, though Thrawn is more polished and refined than the Emperor and Vader, is a genius to boot, and has some good motives for some of his actions, there is little doubt that he is still evil. After all, he is fine with killing incompetent subordinates, kidnapping innocents and handing them over to a homicidal maniac, among other lovely things. There is also no doubt that, though insane, C'baoth is the every bit the clone of his template, one of the more powerful pre-Empire Jedi. All in all, this is quite a challenge for the heroes.Part of the difficulty for the good guys is that Thrawn is careful and smart. He analyzes his enemies, unlike the Emperor and Vader he will retreat from a fight he can't win, and he plans his strategies so that, even when he does lose, he still either gets something, hurts the Republic, or both.One area that Zahn deserves both praise and some slight critique (but mostly praise) is in the area of how ""hard"" his SW books are. In science-fiction circles, there is a scale of ""hardness"" and ""softness"" in regards to the genre. For instance, how much does the story adhere to scientific fact (hard), or just use science jargon or vague ideas to give a template or justification for story elements (soft). Zahn was limited in how much ""hardness"" he could put in the Star Wars books due to the fantastical nature of the series. He still tried. Sometimes this could pull you out of the fantastical elements due to the explanations, which obviously was not a good thing. All in all, this is a tiny criticism, because his keeping the characters grounded made the story more compelling and believable than the truly ridiculous paths many other authors have taken stories down since then. While he is a bit long on explanations and science at times, his grounded approach really has been shown to be for the best.This novel also introduced three characters that would go on to influence future books, and be wildly popular with fans, despite not appearing in any of the films. Said characters are Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Imperial Captain Gilad Pellaeon. It's a testament to the story-telling and world-building skills of Tim Zahn that he was able to create characters that consistently are fan-favorites, even sometimes over movie characters.Of course, this edition of Heir being annotated offers added goodies. As I already stated, there are numerous notes from Zahn and Mitchell about the process of writing the trilogy. These tidbits open a window to the reader about how the tales developed, including what ideas were accepted, rejected, or fine-tuned by the folks at Lucasfilm. To get into the heads of Zahn and Mitchell in some ways helped to almost complete the book, as some questions fans have had about Heir and the rest of The Thrawn Trilogy are answered in the notes.For the Star Wars fan, and really science-fiction fans in general, this is a must-read.Highly Recommended.",5,"US"

I have not read the novel yet but did read all of the annotations and forward, afterward, and introductory comments and they all increased my longing to reread the story itself which I have not done for sometime.

Denis Lawson (Wedge Antilles) does a credible job with the characterizations, well enough for the listener to keep the various characters straight.  His voice does not  drone (important while driving)!  Timothy Zahn has woven a terrific tale of  the newly re-founded Republic and their struggle to survive the remnant of  the now beaten Empire.  Or is it beat?  Admiral Thrawn is simply amazing  (it is difficult to write about someone as being intelligent and actually  having him be that way).  I can add little more to the publisher's notes on  the story.  The audio and special effects are crisp and clear.  Run time:  180 minutes.  Well worth the purchase price!",5,"US"

As for CAPTAIN PELLAEON i  found his position to be intersting in trying to understand his admiral's  tactic's in subverting the republic. Luke seems to be more mature and wiser  in his dealing with other people in the story. Han and Leia have a good  part in the story in that they have individual stories in the latter part  in the book. I found TALON KARRDE to be a good indiction to the STAR WAR'S  story and MARA JADE to be a little annoying about having lost her evil  emperor and not having found luke all those year's.

Now, 20 years later, it is still pretty good, but not great.  The character's feel like the characters from the movies, but at times it seems contrived how they are always right where the big villains plans are, and they sometimes seem to thwart it too easily.

2015-01-01,"Like many other folks","Like many other folks, Heir to the Empire jumpstarted my re-entry in Star Wars. This footnoted re-release adds a great behind-the-scenes layer, the textual equivalent of a DVD commentary track.

2014-05-25,"What I Want In Star Wars","Heir to the Empire is great Star Wars literature. It feels similar to A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, but I actually like this more. The characters are dynamic, the dialogue is all well-done, the settings are spectacular and the plot is distinctly dark. That is what I want in Star Wars. Although I am not a big fan of A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi, I can definitely get into this.",5,"US"

It takes place immediately after the events of ""return of the Jedi"" and has all the same characters plus a whole new crew as well. It's a very smooth read with characters that all had depth and personality. Brilliantly written, it should have been made into a movie. Lots of unexpected moments. Must read, you'll be hooked.",5,"US"
2011-09-14,"The best Star Wars expanded universe book","Since I just added it to my Wish List, I cannot comment on whether this new edition is worth buying for those who already have the original book. But I definitely can say that if you have not, BUY IT NOW and READ IT. Heir (and the following 2 books from the Thrawn Trilogy) are easily the best books ever from the Star Wars expanded universe.In fact, I do believe that if George Lucas ever did the chapters 7-9 (which he mentioned once he would not due to matters of his and the original actors ages), they would be these 3 books. And what movies would they be...The books are much more like the original trilogy in how they flow than the prequel trilogy. The pace, the character building, the plots, the twists, the duels, the new additions to the story, all of them take their time to happen, instead of the frantic nature of the prequel movies (and most current movies btw). So magic can be built and appreciated on the reader's mind. Nothing seems irrelevant in the story, nevertheless the story is quite detailed and complex. And yet, it's not a complex reading.Instead of the master-apprentice domination-or-betrayal relationship between the Emperor and Vader, we have the master cunning strategist Imperial Admiral Thrawn (a Spock-lookalike version of German Otto von Bismarck) coming back from the Outer Rims just to find out that his Empire was defeated by the rebels. But he finds and enters an allegiance with long lost Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth (which could be described as a Sith version of Lord Of The Rings Saruman). Thrawn plays his battle tactics like a chess master and always seems to be two steps ahead of the former rebels. And his plans involve a new creature called ysalamiri, that despite the awful name are unique animals whose abilities will permeate the whole trilogy and affect many of the action in the book. On his side, C'baoth wants the future children of Han and Leia to be his apprentices.Luke still has ways to go on his path to become a Jedi Master and sees in C'baoth the opportunity to learn from a Master. But he is also confronted with Mara Jade,a skilled red haired bounty hunter with previous associations with the Empire on her path to revenge. And related to all that, we are introduced to the delicious characters of Talon Karrde, a more tactful Han Solo-like smuggler and pragmatic decision maker whose allegiances are always on the move, and of the Noghri, a species that seem to be a kind of blend between the Ewoks and Bobba Fett.Finally, we have another Lando Calrisian mining adventure on a weird planet, several Rogue Squadron battles like in Episode 4 and 6, some quality time spent at Chewbacca's planet (forget the prequels...) and Leia is learning her ways in the force, although she works as a politician in Coruscant.In a nutshell, Star Wars as it should be.Besides the Heir Trilogy, I believe that the best Star Wars books are the books between Episode 6 and The Heir trilogy, the first X-Wing books, and some of the Yuuzhan Vong stories (not all of them unfortunately, the series started well, but then it went on a roller coaster succession of ups and downs, ending up lost in itself).",5,"US"

2015-04-04,"Book 2 and 3 are the best in the 3 part series","Book 2 and 3 are the best in the 3 part series, but 1 is essential, of course. It's a little slow in some places, but overall, keeps a solid pace. The best part of this book is how it sets up Thrawn, who is a cunning enemy. My biggest complaint is the reused lines from the original trilogy.",4,"US"
2012-04-30,"Excellent book, excellent edition","Let me start by saying, Heir to the Empire is by far my favorite Star Wars novel.  If you only ever read one thing in the Star Wars extended universe, read this trilogy.  The characters are spot-on, and those newly introduced are interesting and memorable.  The plot is well-paced, exciting, and just complex enough to hold up to multiple re-reads without being confusing the first time through.  Definitely a worthy follow-up to the original trilogy!As for the 20th anniversary edition, I really liked the author's notes and comments.  They added a fascinating glimpse into the writing process and gave a lot of background information that I hadn't known before.  I'd definitely recommend it!  A quick caution, though: many of the notes can be spoiler-y, so if this is your first read, you may want to skip them.My understanding is that in the actual book edition, the notes are written in the margins and impossible to skip.  However, I read the kindle version, and was able to jump back and forth between text and endnotes with ease.  This is the first kindle book I've read with its own annotations, and I was impressed!  Simple, easy to use, and almost seamless - definitely beats flipping back and forth in a thick book!  Also, included the same cover illustration as the hardcover edition, which I appreciate - too many kindle books have bland, nondescript covers.All in all, highly recommended for first-time or veteran Star Wars fans.  Can't wait for the new editions of the rest of the trilogy - I'll be downloading those, too!",5,"US"

2011-09-25,"One of a kind","This book is amazing. The book itself is great. Heir is easily one of my favorite Star Wars books of all time and the 20th anniversary edition is a work of art in its own right. The amount of detail that Tim Zann added to this version of the book makes it well worth the cost to me. The extras may get in the way for anyone looking to just read the book, but for someone like me who had already read the book a few years ago this was a way to own the book and learn some more about the Star Wars universe.The actual story itself is classic Star Wars, with the main characters getting into problems forced on them by other characters and themselves. The empire is still the bad guy, but some of the characters show a different side to the empire than is normally portrayed by other writers and in the films.Bottom line: buy this if you have ever wanted to own a copy of the book. Also, if you have been reading Star Wars and have never read this book read it now. This was the original Star Wars book.",5,"US"
2002-08-28,"Similar to the movie, maybe too much","This comic book nowadays called graphic novels, is quite similar to the movie, maybe too much. While it leaves out key spoiler scenes it does recreate the feel and sequences of the movie quite well. The dialogs are of course adapted to the medium and the drawings are quite simple and straightforward, yet beautiful. One of the flaws of this graphic novel is that it does not add much to the plot or the pciture itself, while it could have been used to tell the unseen part of the movie, it just recreates it the most faithfully and accurately possible. I think it's more a souvenir or collectible than a real comic book. Worth getting if you collect SW stuff.",4,"US"

All the characters act just like they did in the films, and all your favorites are given a chance to shine. Unlike the prequels, the new characters introduced in this novel are interesting and alot of fun. In many ways this is what the prequel trilogy should have been, or at least the feel of it.

2012-07-09,"The First EU Novel I Ever Bought As A Kid","I remember being in a store somewhere as a young kid and seeing Heir To The Empire. I liked Star Wars a lot and I liked reading, so I asked my mother could I get it. I think at the time I lost interest rather quickly as I don't think I finished reading it until a few years later when I was a little older. But I ultimately became a HUGE Star Wars EU fan up until the NJO came out (which effectively killed my interest in the EU--I'm sorry to those fans of it, but it's true). I've read about what's taken place after the NJO and quite honestly much of it I can't seem to bring myself to be okay with. One fun memory as a young child I have of HTTE is I remember thinking that the ""heir"" was Leia since she was a princess.But that aside, Heir to the Empire begins five years after ROTJ. Here, we have the Rebellion now the New Republic and has Coruscant. The Empire is still around but is in splinters and their reach is dwindling each day. Things are looking up for the New Republic. That is, until an Imperial Grand Admiral returns from the Unknown Regions. This admiral is Grand Admiral Thrawn who is likely my favorite EU character. Thrawn is a Chiss, a blue humanoid alien, whose leadership and fighting abilities are so great, he is the only non-human in the entire Imperial military, much less in such a high position.Along with his second-in-command, Captain Pellaeon, another long-standing EU character, he sets out to destroy the New Republic with the help of a cloned dark Jedi.  All the while Leia is pregnant with twins and is learning to be a Jedi from Luke, Han is trying to get smugglers to work for the New Republic, and Luke is concerned about visions he keeps having all the while as this new mysterious Imperial warlord is beginning his attacks.Other than a few grammar issues I've noticed so far, Heir to the Empire is good read and a definite good place to start for any new EU readers. As time went on, EU novels began referencing other novels and events to the point a new reader might get lost. Being the Thrawn trilogy was the first of our modern EU, it helps out a lot in that way. The characters and novel itself were well written. Someone once said that they could see the actual actors saying the characters' lines had this been an actual movie. I'm inclined to agree.",5,"US"

The characters were great, and didn't feel forced. The story was interesting, and I liked that the New Republic was portrayed as having some very basic government issues like trying to establish where they fit into the galaxy. I think it made the story seem more genuine because it was in keeping with how an actual take over and renewal of government would proceed. The writing was not fantastic, but the character and story made up for up. All in all, I would definitely recommend the book and am excited to finish the next two books in the trilogy!",4,"US"

It's possible that numerous complaints led to a full re-scan of the original material, because I was only able to spot a couple of single spelling mistakes in the entire book - interestingly, it was the same word every time.

One example Thrawn and that Captain Paelleons perspective, I don't know it just seemed like Thrawn was a bit too arrogant and Paelleon was a bit too whiny.

It's an early book, originally printed in the early 90s so you'll probably notice some inconsistencies with the movie canon established in the prequels. Despite that though, Zahn gives a fun read and introduces one of the best characters in the EU, Grand Admiral Thrawn. Another really nice feature about this particular edition is it includes author notes about the story which adds a nice little inside look into the publishing process with LucasFilm. Zahn also discusses his thoughts on some of his writing decisions and how they have been changed by the subsequent movies.

I'm simply writing briefly about the Kindle edition of this 20th Anniversary edition.While the hardcover has the notes by Timothy Zahn in the margins, this Kindle edition has hyperlinks which you have to scroll over and click on, which take you to a section in the back of the book with all the notations.  I thought this would be a major pain, but it's not bad at all.  It's very quick still and I never felt annoyed by it.  I would've preferred a hardcover copy to be honest (and recommend that if you have the option), but I live in Korea now so I had to download the Kindle version.  That said, I'm very satisfied with having bought this edition.The notes themselves are more entertaining than I'd expected.  I thought they'd be boring, tedious notes, but they give great insight into the story, the SW universe, as well as cool production notes such as limitations with what he was contractually allowed to do, and so on.I'd highly recommend getting this book in either format and especially for any Star Wars fan or fan of light sci-fi/fantasy novels.P.S. PLEASE support this book by purchasing it if you're interested.  The publisher has stated that if this edition is successful enough they'll release similar 20th anniversary editions of Dark Force Rising and The Last Command.",5,"US"
2017-06-11,"Loves it!!","This was a work of art. In my personal opinion this book should have been the real episode seven of the series.",5,"US"
2013-07-09,"Thrawn series is still awesome","The only complaint I have about this eBook edition is...why are all of the other ones so expensive? I'm not paying any more for an eBook copy than I would for a used paperback. Drop them all down to $2 and I'll think about it.",5,"US"
2015-09-08,"Wonderful addition to the expanded story of Star Wars","I really enjoyed reading Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire. This was the first book I read with Mara Jade and after that I feel in love with her character. Grand Admiral Thrawn also makes his appearance as the one of the new villian's our heroes must face. Talon Karrde who works along side Mara Jade is a pirate smuggler type of character. We are also introduced to him. On addition we get a great story with the main three Luke, Han and Leia. And of course Lando, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3po. If you want to learn more about what happens after Return of the Jedi, this is a great book to pick up. I' d recommend buying the 20th anniversary edition, which included side notes by Zahn and the editor. Very interesting info.All in all it's a wonderful edition to the Star Wars Saga!",5,"US"
2017-11-11,"Still a great book","I read this when it was first released in hardcover. Reading again now its still an epic Star Wars story that aches to be translated onto film.",5,"US"
2018-01-21,"Fun, if shallow","The Thrawn trilogy is generally regarded as one of the better bits of extended universe fiction, and reading through it (almost done with the third book) I can understand why. It's engaging, fun to read, the new characters bring some freshness to the mix -- plus it's Star Wars, so there's Star Wars stuff. If you like Star Wars stuff... yeah, you'll like this.My only complaint would be that it's very fan fictiony, and that the characters are basically taken in a straight line from the end of the original trilogy. Nothing too innovative or risky happening here; it's almost as if the author was afraid people wouldn't know who the characters were if they had grown or changed at all since Return of the Jedi. The story jumps through a few weird hoops to reunite us with characters we'll recognize (in lieu of making new ones), and it can be a bit cringey at times as it tries to remind us of who these people are (""Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight, thought back to the time he was at Jabba's palace"" kind of stuff).All that said, when the story isn't desperately shouting ""HEY REMEMBER THIS"" at you, it's a fun romp around the galaxy. Thrawn is a compelling villain (though a little TOO omniscient, if you ask me), and Mara Jade is probably the best non-canon Star Wars character ever. If you're a fan looking to experience a bit of what Disney murdered in their acquisition (although we can see now it was to good ends), this is as good a place as any to start.",4,"US"
2015-04-17,"... only 3 of them) and as much as I loved this, it felt like the story had ended","I had watched all the Star Wars movies growing up (back when there were only 3 of them) and as much as I loved this, it felt like the story had ended.  There was no sign of any new movies (granted, with my opinion on Episodes I, II and III, this might not have been a bad thing) and the only novels were either outdated (Splinters of the Minds Eye) or only loosely connected (The adventures of Lando Calrissian).  Then one day I stumbled across Heir to the Empire in the library.  Even though I was trying very hard to deny my inner-geek, I checked it out and took it home, trying to hide it among my others books.The introduction was interesting enough but the first moment I was truly hooked was when I realized that Han Solo's obvious backup was the same fighter pilot who had gone against two Death Stars.  Wedge Antilles hadn't made much of an impression on me in any of the movies that I had ever noticed. . .but I recognized his name immediately and from there, I was hooked.  Despite enjoying the story so much, I wasn't planning on reading the second book (I had seen a ""coming soon"" on the inside cover and I was still trying not to be sort of person who read Star Wars books (I was young and foolish).  However, I hadn't realized that Heir to the Empire would end with a ""to be continued"" and I couldn't get Dark Force Rising fast enough for me (I had to wait almost four months until The Last Command).Heir to the Empire is an extraordinarily detailed re-visit to a galaxy far, far away.  The plot is complex and well drawn and the characters were a fantastic mix of the ones we had known and a new group of villains, heroes (willing and reluctant); not all Imperials are bad and not all members of the New Republic are good and Timothy Zahn pays homage to one of the greatest epics of our lifetime.",5,"US"
2017-08-24,"Loving the bad guy","Book is well written and an easy read. Beautifully designed and lain out for the reader of any age. Thrawn is amazing! Can't help but love him.",5,"US"
2012-05-11,"Outstanding","I'm a huge fan of listening to the movie commentaries on DVDs and that's exactly what we get with the 20th Anniversary Edition of Heir to the Empire. Reading notations about what went into the creation of great characters such as Thrawn and Mara Jade from Timothy Zahn himself was excellent. I was a little hesitant about getting the Kindle version since all the footnotes are in the back. Fortunately, navigating through them while I was reading the story was simple.As for the book itself, The Thrawn Trilogy is still the best piece of literature in the Star Wars Expanded Universe.",5,"US"

2013-12-28,"Perfect for beginning your journey into the Expanded Universe","I am new reading Star Wars books but I have always been a huge fan of the movies. Playing the video games when I was younger has further developed my interest in the world of Star Wars. This book is where I was told to start, and what a start.Zahn is a great writer. The ease of reading and the page turning suspense helped make this read a very enjoyable one. The amount of detail along with the action is a perfect mix. This book follows the movies so it takes place when Luke is older. So this track is perfect to take if you want to learn about what happens after the movies.",5,"US"

We also meet new interesting characters, races and learn some on the history of Darth Vader.I also liked the way the author uses some lines of the characters in the movies, but then sometimes it is a bit too much (specially with Solo).The story seems consistent with the movies, indeed they feel a bit shallow after this reading.",4,"US"

It's mostly a ""catch up"" with the lives of the main characters Luke, Han, Lei & others but lacks a little bit more of action.

2015-07-18,"Five Stars + a Small Criticism","I agree with the most essential elements of the many five star reviews. It was a delight to be reacquainted with the Star Wars family. Mr. Zahn is an excellent story teller, but he has one habit which just irks me; and that is he often uses the construct of ""the other"" rather than a character's name or a pronoun. The good news is that this small writing flaw (as I believe it is) can be easily corrected by a global word search of ""the other"" and substituted with a name or ""she"", ""he"", ""him"", ""her"" , or ""it"" as appropriate by the writer or an editor. Indeed, it seems that an editor should have attended to this.",5,"US"
2013-04-06,"Enjoyed the story.","I enjoyed the story but it didn't live up to the hype I'd always heard about. There were some parts of the story that were visually (or so how I saw it in my mind) just incredible and as good as anything else in the Star Wars EU, overall it was ok. I thought the author over used a few descriptive words and phrases... that made me remember some of the Dean Koontz books that got so formulaic that I stopped reading his stuff. True, there are several misspellings in the kindle version. A couple of times I had to back up and reread a few sentences, but it wasn't really annoying to me. I know I'll eventually read the two books after this one. I find that as a Star Wars fan, I like fitting more pieces of the overall story into place. So, for that reason and that alone, there's no reason no to pick it up.",3,"US"

We follow the storylines of our main characters as they are harassed by political infighting and a brilliant tactician from the remenants of the Empire, Grand Admiral Thrawn.It's an awesome read that shows a lot of additional character development (especially for Leia and Han, something that was lacking in the Luke-centric movie trilogy) and answers many of the questions of what happens after the defeat of the Emperor.I just hope the book isn't rendered moot by the upcoming movies.",5,"US"

Zahn also created a Han and Leia love story, a Luke Jedi Master adventure and meeting his future bride, Lando and Chewie both add their own valuable assistance at every turn to make this a true continuation of the Star Wars main story.Highly recommended as a second or third time read, as I have, but even more strongly recommended for first time readers of the trilogy.Awaken the Force within you ;-)",5,"US"

2011-09-06,"A celebration of the rebirth of Star Wars","Timothy Zahn is very humble in the introduction to this 20th anniversary edition trying not to take credit for ""restarting"" Star Wars in the early 90's but the reality is that this novel did exactly that for me and millions of other fans and still to this day is the centerpiece and starting point for so many people jumping in to the Star Wars Expanded Universe.This book is the ""The Empire Strikes Backs"" of Star Wars novels.  One of the first and definitely one of the best and it still holds up incredibly well to this day with very few issues regarding canon on top of being such a great read.My favorite aspect of this anniversary edition is probably the annotations done by Zahn, written in the margins of the book, exploring key concepts, characters or just noting on how to pronounce names.  It really adds a new layer of depth to the novel and helps get inside of his head during and after his writing process.  These alone are worth the purchase price to fans of the book who may have read this before.On top of that we get a forward from Lucas Licensing, an introduction by Zahn, both recapping the history of this novel and its beginnings.And lastly the a novella from Zahn is included titled ""Crisis of Faith"", which you may want to read after you read his latest book ""Choices of One"".  It gives a new look into Grand Admiral Thrawn that should not be missed.This is a fantastic package for the price and a must-own for any fans of the ""Thrawn Trilogy"" as it is commonly referred as.",5,"US"

2012-12-09,"First dabble into a Star Wars novel...absolutely hooked!","Upon hearing Disney's acquisition of the Star Wars rights, I decided to take up a recommendation to dive into this trilogy.  Boy have I missed out.  I finished the first and I can say it felt like a continuation of the original movies.  Definitely worth a read!",5,"US"

2002-08-19,"Decent, but hardly great sci-fi","I was hoping that Zahn had managed to write some good, mature Star Wars books, but was dissapointed that it was just more mediocre writing and plot development wrapped up in the Star Wars universe. The characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is simplistic and relies on amazing coincidence to advance.Nothing really special here, and I doubt I will bother reading the other two books in the series.",3,"US"
2013-03-20,"Justice for the original cinematic trilogy","Greatly congruent with the style and pace of George Lucas' original cinematic trilogy. Mostly well written, with only a few redundancies throughout. Overall, a great continuation of where Return of the Jedi left off",4,"US"
2017-07-09,"Disappointing","Writing quality: 3/5Character development: 2/5World creation: 2/5Thought provoking: 1/5Story: 1/5Just read Thrawn and was impressed but this book shows the author at his early stages where all of the characters sound similar and act predictably.  I think he is further limited by having to work with characters like Luke, Léa, and  Han that are boxed in by their movie personalities.  The depiction of Luke in particular makes home seem a bit slow.  In the end it comes off as flat.",2,"US"

2013-05-29,"making Star Wars cool again","Zahn is so descriptive. You can see the events. Imagine the characters, hear their voices. He understands the spirit and personalities of the Star Wars characters and the universe. He doesn't lose the reader with complicated scientific gobbledygook. He makes his writing believable. He singlehandedly created the Star Wars ""Extended Universe"". This has made me want to read all of his works.",5,"US"

2017-09-14,"Unnecessary additions do not add much","Heir to the Empire is a great book in itself, the problem comes elsewhere.From a design point of view, the cover is terrible and dust jacket was already worn down when delivered. The original painting that served as the cover is relegated to the cover in silver rather than in full colour. This doesn't bode well for the book, as the additional annotations at times treat the reader like an idiot, and generally add nothing to the story itself as they are. They only mess up the layout, and with those with abnormal eyesight, it's a chore to read.The annotations would've served better if Timothy Zahn would've discussed the topics he raises in these annotations in a separate, expanded chapter where he discusses the creation of the book topic by topic. As the annotations are now, they're an eyesore and at times take away the mystique of the characters.The newly included novella, while decent, does leave slightly sour taste. It would've served better if it had been modified as a new introduction chapter to the main novel itself.In short, all the additions, outside forewords, take away from the overall value of the package. The original pressing may lack the extras, yet it is much better to read. The only reason to pick this over the possibly cheaper release is that it's more available around and guaranteed to be in good shape, unless your mailer shoves the book into a bag and calls it a day.",2,"US"
2012-11-21,"Excellent Read","I have not read many Star Wars novels, my knowledge of the Star Wars universe is limited to the films and The Old Republic era which takes place thousands of years before the films.  As such this review is not a comparison to other novels in the expanded universe.The book featured characters everyone will be familiar with (Luke, Han, etc) as well many new characters.  There are some recycled lines from the films, but the focus of the story is not back towards the films but towards an uncertain future.  It is an interesting story with a new threat, well-written and relatively fast paced.  All the characters are fleshed-out, and not just caricatures of the actors in the films.  Luke and Han feel true to their nature with signs of a little more maturity (but not too much).  Several of the new characters face an interesting problem, not wanting to seem to side with either the New Republic or the Empire, as the ultimate victor is unknown.Ultimately a very enjoyable read, one need not have advanced knowledge of the expanded Star Wars universe to enjoy the story.  I kept turning pages when I should be getting some sleep, which is high praise in my mind.",4,"US"
2014-03-22,"What a beginning","I am 30, and had never read any of the EU. I found this book as the first recommended to read after the VI movie and it did not dissapoint. The characters are just how you remember them and I will be looking for more : )",5,"US"

2014-05-16,"A Sequel Worthy of the Star Wars Universe","After the success of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, interest in the saga began to wane a little and LucasFilm decided to authorize the creation of novels set in the ""Star Wars"" universe, specifically ones set after the events of the third (sixth) film: ""Return of the Jedi"".Timothy Zahn does a great job at writing all of the characters from the ""Star Wars"" trilogy with the appropriate voices, and creates situations that are believable given the environment.At times reading through the novel I laughed; other times I cried. At all times though I heard Luke, Leia, Han, and Lando in their exact voices from the film. At points I could even image what John Williams incredible score would sound like over some of the more epic parts of the book.Zahn also takes the liberty of adding to the ""Star Wars"" mythos by creating new characters including Grand Admiral Thrawn and Mara Jade, the Emperor's Hand to name just two. While I didn't have actual voices or appearances to match with these characters, at least in the cinematic sense, I was still able to picture and hear these characters believably alongside the likenesses of Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee Williams.Zahn definitely has me hooked in to read the other two books to see where this story goes. And even if Episode VII sucks, we'll always have the Thrawn trilogy.",4,"US"

2012-11-20,"Fast-paced, gripping Star Wars tale","Recently I've had great fun playing Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures Game Core Set and the experience inspired me to return to the Star Wars universe; particularly the expanded universe. I was advised to start with the Thrawn trilogy and I recommend others do the same. Heir to the Empire is well-written, fast-paced, smart and exciting. Grand Admiral Thrawn, Talon Karde, Mara Jade and troubled Jedi Master C'baoth are fascinating new characters thrown into the mix along with the well-known heroes from the movies. Zahn sketches fairly skeletal visual descriptions of locales, characters and races and instead focuses almost entirely on the action, dialog and propelling the story forward. In this he succeeds. I found the book hard to put down. Zahn has a tendency to draw a bit too much from the movies scripts for his dialog, recycling a number of famous lines for Luke, Han, Lando and Leia dialog. Understandable and perhaps necessary to an extent but I felt that it was a weak point and broke the spell of the story for me, if briefly. That aside Heir to the Empire introduces interesting new characters, conflicts and challenges into the well-loved Star Wars universe and does a masterful job telling an exciting story of the continuing galactic war after the destruction of the second Death Star.",4,"US"

Where the Dark Empire series took a turn for the ridiculous, the Thrawn trilogy tends to go more towards subtlety. Granted there are definitely moments of, ""Of all the spaceships in all the planets, the bad guy was right there?!?!"" But this is not supposed to be some literary romp through space and time.

2016-05-04,"Don't agree with the hype - Mild Spoilers","I had never read any Star Wars novels before until last year when I TRIED reading Aftermath (gawd, what dreck that was), but have been a huge fan of the films since I was a kid.  I decided to try this book out because so many people miffed that JJ Abrams and Disney abandoned the EU expressed strongly-held convictions that the Thrawn trilogy was the most worthy successor to  Return of the Jedi, and deserved it's rightful place in film canon.  I figured I'd give it a try.  Mostly it was a fast fun read, I pretty much tore through it, but partially out of spite, I just wanted it to be over.  I'll give it points for being readable.As for the story and character development?  Meh.  If this book stood alone, without the character development of the films you wouldn't care a lick about Leia, Han, Luke, or Chewy.  And contrary to most positive reviewers' assessments, I found neither Thrawn nor Mara Jade particularly compelling additions to the cast.  In the case of Thrawn, he seemed like an inferior version of the Mule from Asimov's Foundation trilogy.  In the case of Mara Jade, her motivations were supposed to be the big reveal of the storyline, and they're finally offered in the most unsatisfying way (an admission) and ultimately lack the expected motivation (her feelings are hurt because the prestige she believed she had, she lost, but as her admission goes on, you realize that same prestige was only in her own mind, since her true role prior to her life being ruined was a secret).But the worst of all of the characters (an opinion I'm baffled so many find to the contrary) is the ""Dark Jedi Clone"" C'Baoth (a name that was so gratingly irritating to pronounce in my mind as I read, I wanted to toss the book every time it appeared).  His introduction is like a Monty Python skit about an evil wizard:  ""Mwuahahaha!  I'm so EVIL.  I killed the other evil Jedi who used to guard this evil mountain full of evil stuff"",(what's even the purpose of that plot point?), ""Now I will invite you in and kill you with my force lighten.. Wha? Furry lizard?  I'll bite your legs off"".  Which brings us to the ysalamiri.  Creatures that block the force with anti-force bubbles?  The all encompassing energy that is created by life, surrounds us, and binds the universe together?  Ugh.Aside from the character development, I found each character's narrative and motivation contrived and full of holes that the author went to great pains to explain away through convoluted if-then-therefore situations that went on ceaselessly in each character's head.  Each individual storyline, particularly Leia's, was completely disconnected from an overlying story arc (other than Thrawn's rising influence, or in the case of Luke and Han - a coincidental visit to the same planet).  Other annoying details include a Wookie whose speech impediment enables him to speak English (or Basic if you prefer), the ""scent"" of Vader, re-use of dialogue from the original Trilogy as a substitute for development of existing characters (and I'm not just talking about ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" - which I have no qualms with reusing).Bottom line, if you're a Star Wars canon obsessive who enjoys the ""Science-Fictioning"" of Star Wars through explanations for various aspects of the Galaxy far, far away that seem counter-intuitive, self-contradictory, or just plain mistakes in plotting (a la Wookipedia), then this book might appeal to you.  If you don't care about the logical inconsistencies of the OT films and view them as their own separate (and superior) canon:  i.e., fun space fantasies with characters you adored as a child, I'd skip this and the rest of the novels in the series.  I won't be reading any further.",2,"US"

2011-09-16,"Consider the ebook carefully","For those who are considering the Kindle version, take a moment to think about the mechanics of reading it. The hardcover version has the annotations in the margins of the pages, meaning you can easily ready, shift your eyes over to the notes and continue reading. The ebook has the notes all the way in the back. The annotations are numbered in the text of the book, and those numbers are hyperlinked, so you can go back and forth between the two, but I have to say it's a bit slow. I'm on a Nook Color, but even overclocked to 1.2 ghz, it takes about one to two full seconds to go back and forth. It doesn't sound like much, but some chapters have 20 annotations, that's a lot of time waiting to go back and forth. Further, if the annotation falls on the margin of a page, you can easily confuse your ereader as it won't know if you're trying to turn a page or link to the annotation.Still, I can't fault the content here.

2015-12-11,"Vastly Overrated","I read the Thrawn trilogy for the first time last year. Since then I've had trouble deciding how I feel about it.I think that it's far too long, for beginners. It lacks the punch of the films, the epic sweep, the feeling of a galaxy teeming with life. On a second reading, the places that Zahn constructs are small, difficult to picture in your mind, and fail to capture a living, breathing world. In this sense, Zahn's writing is lackluster.I hate his new characters, especially Talon Karrde, who in my opinion is an extremely one-dimensional character and too similar to Han Solo.I like Thrawn and have no problem with his character. In fact, Zahn's most recent book ""Thrawn"" is a a way better book than the Thrawn trilogy and succeeds in its worldbuilding, despite having problems with pacing.I suspect that many of the five star reviews and Zahn worship stem from the fact that in comparison to other works, particularly of the Bantam era, Zahn's books are the most plausible and best written. But that's not saying very much. I am struggling to want to get through these books a second time while doing a slower, more careful reading, and I'm probably going to give up on the effort.I think that these books are extremely overrated. I think that the Aftermath trilogy, despite having annoying modern USA political messages, is far better written, particularly with regard to its worldbuilding, and presents a superior version of the post-ROTJ events than the Thrawn trilogy.",2,"US"
2011-06-15,"Completely Devoid of Any Star Wars Magic","I just finished The Thrawn Trilogy, and I agree very much with what I've read in the 1-star and 2-star reviews. This trilogy was nothing at all like the original Star Wars movies. I forced myself to read the 1,400 pages, just so I could say I read it and know I gave it a chance. The familiar characters -- Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, Chewie, and the droids -- had no real life to them, not very much personality at all. And the new characters -- Thrawn, Paelleon, Mara, Karrde, and C'baoth -- were really boring. I felt no attachment whatsoever to any of them. And most important of all, there was absolutely no mythological layer to the entire story, which is what the magic of the original Star Wars is all about. I honestly would not recommend The Thrawn Trilogy to anyone. If you want to read a good Star Wars novel, read Steve Perry's Shadows of the Empire.",2,"US"

2016-04-30,"I'll take Thrawn over Kylo Ren any day of the week","What happens after the Ewoks stop dancing and the fiery remains of the Death Star finally smolder out? The real work begins - at least according to Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire, the kickass start to the best trilogy in the extended universe.Five years post-Empire-goes-boom, the Rebel Alliance is still trying to make this whole intergalactic governance thing work. As with most polyglot insurgencies, the allies find that now that the one thing that truly united them - a hatred of the Empire's oppression - is (mostly) gone, they maybe don't have so much in common. Leia spends most of her time putting out diplomatic fires, which strains her relationship with Han. Luke spends most of his time as a figurehead. Lando's taken up mining (because that worked out so well last time). And what's left of the Empire worries at them like an old dog with a bone it just won't let go...until a forgotten Grand Admiral emerges to take charge of the remaining Imperial forces and sets about reclaiming his territory.Zahn's book isn't perfect. Looking back on it now, his cast of characters is ridiculously homogenous - true, the main characters are canon, but he could have thrown us a little diversity in the supporting cast instead of leaving Lando the lonely only person of color (unless, maybe, you read Thrawn as a coded minority, but I think that's my reading and not the author's intent). That's an issue that obviously wasn't at the forefront in 1991 when this book was released, though The Force Awakens throws it into sharp relief by contrast. Even with that failing, the novel remains one of my all-time favorites, with complex characters - smuggler Talon Kardde; the mysterious Mara Jade; and that Sherlock Holmes of a Grand Admiral himself, Thrawn, who deserved his own movie, dammit - moving through a hell of a complex plot. It feels like Zahn took his story cues from Dune, recognizing that political intrigue makes the best science fiction.Twenty-five years after its initial publication, Heir to the Empire remains, for me, the ultimate in Star Wars. And even Disney's retroactive canon-wiping can't take that away from me.",5,"US"

2018-09-13,"The Saga continues","I grew up on the original Star Wars trilogy and have read a few of the books now labeled as ‘Legends’. I completely understood when Disney acquired the Stars Wars universe that it was better to make the expanded universe legends, but there were a number of those books that are great stories with fantastic characters. After many years and the influx of new movies (some good and some not so much), I was surprised to see that a ‘legend’ character (Thrawn) was being introduced back into canon. Before I venture into the new Thrawn books, I thought it a good time to read the original.“Heir to the Empire’ takes us a few years after the destruction of the second Death Star, the Emperor, and Vader. The new Republic is struggling to establish trust and control in the galaxy. The Empire is scattered, but a force is regrouping and plans are now in motion. The central focus of the Empire is Grand Admiral Thrawn. A blue skinned, red eyed, humanoid who is an overwhelming power and brilliant tactician. Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and many more familiar characters are working to strengthen the Republic. Thrawn is playing a game of cat and mouse to establish the Empire. Can the old crew stop Thrawn before it is too late.This book is one of the better options if you are looking for more from the Star Wars universe. Keep in mid this trilogy is still considered “legend’, but it is well done and a great launching point for a new villain (Thrawn) and another new mysterious character named Mara Jade. By the end of the book, our heroes have realized who they are up against, and must find a way to stop him. I really enjoyed the book and I’m looking forward to the second installment.",4,"US"
2018-08-20,"Fine listen, but really lets you know how much Zahn loves to use the word ""sardonically.""","I listened to Zahn's first installment in the ""Thrawn trilogy"" with the audiobook. I tried reading the book but just couldn't get into it. I found it a bit dry. After recently getting into audiobooks, I saw this in my recommendations and decided to give it a try a second time, but in a new format. Took me a while to finish, but I finally got through it. The narrator does a fantastic job in general, but I feel he could work on his female voices. To be fair, they don't really have strong dialogues in the book.The novel is fine. It's a great story following the events of the first three Star Wars films. Now, I write this in 2018. I have the prequels, The Clone Wars, the Disney acquisition, The Force Awakens, etc. Going back to these books for the first time with all this knowledge wasn't as jarring as I anticipated. I just have to remember there's nothing preceding these stories save for the original films, and the character of Thrawn is enough to keep me engaged.That said, there's a lot of dry moments in this story. The story is more so political than the first three films; it's more reminiscent of the prequels, but at the same time these are novels, so there are more time and space to fill out the plots and backgrounds. I did feel that the female characters weren't as developed either but going from the previous material that's not saying much. Still, the female characters had the weakest dialogue, I feel.The story was fine. What really drove it was Thrawn and Luke.",3,"US"

This must have been one of the first because there are barley any sound fx or music cues, the guy who played Wedge in the movies reads this one, though Anthony Daniels (C-3p0) reads the other two - odd! Any way, he gives a slow, dry performance that could put you to sleep. So many people said the plot was action packed, equal to the movies but the dialog scenes seemed to drag out endlessley to make up for the short action scenes. Just the tone of the book seemed off from the movies, the pacing totally different. And the most anoying part of any of the audio books - they all pronounce Courascant as ""Chorus-scant."" Maybe the books were better but the plot was not interesting enough to bring me back for book two. Shadow of the Empire, however seemed pitch perfect, and the voice actor was able to to a different voice for every character that really made it come alive - at least in the audio book.",1,"US"

There are little nuances that don't fit in post-prequel Star Wars, but the book has stood up remarkably well to the test of time.  With a few tweaks to account for the time difference, the Clone Wars, and Sith terminology; this plot would have been infinitely better than the new sequel trilogy now.The setting of government trying to transition from Rebellion to Republic is perhaps more relevant today than it was 25 years ago when this trilogy was released, as are the topics of Thrawn's race in the Empire and the delicate balance Leia is facing between her professional (government), personal (Han), and religious (Jedi training) lives.The only reason this book doesn't have 5 stars is because Timothy Zahn's writing style is a little bit lazy at times, repeating the same expressions and descriptions and using cliches that belong in 20th century America rather than the Star Wars universe.  For example, what exactly does ""do we have a green light""... ""the light is green"" mean literally in Star Wars?  I have never heard of or seen a traffic light in Star Wars.  Zahn also throws out made-up names for maneuvers and so thoroughly fails to describe them, that the reader really has no idea how to imagine a battle unfolding except that it's working in the speaker's favor.Writing aside, Zahn created a masterpiece of a plot and backdrop that is every bit the spiritual succession of Star Wars that fans of the series deserved.NOTE: Some vendors have images of the original paperback as their product image.  I bought one of those, but was sorely disappointed when I got the ""Legends"" mass-market paperback edition.  It's the same book, but just with a different cover.  Buyer beware.",4,"US"
2018-01-28,"Incredible. One of my favorite grade school memories was reading this book.","This series has been my favorite star wars novel series. It comes quite close and at time even over takes the original three Lucas movies in the early eighties. It captures much of what those movies had, added a lot of new things all the while giving us what we wanted. To so many of us starwars is really important, probably more important than it should be, but none the less it is. When i first read these books i remember thing these are what they should make movies out of. They are just perfect. Even 20 years later reading them again at 40 they are still so much fun. At least for me we'll always have these books. I like the new movies, but not as well i just don't feel like the characters have the dynamic, chemistry or the struggle of the originals. Everything comes so easy to Ray it is hard to relate to. Rest assured if you haven't read these you'll still see all the old characters with their imperfections better than ever but but still with all the great flaws that allowed us to relate to them and made us love them.Finally other than the characters this is is an incredible story. It flows well, is tight and you really care about the characters. I always thought Han was my favorite character, but after reading these again it may actually be Talon Karrde. The guy is just like Han but didn't become respectable.By the way i also got these on audio book for my daughter, and I'll tell you what they are about as close to a movie as you'll get. They have sound effects, and the narrator Marc Thompson is unbelievable. About the only voice he didn't get quite right is leia (woman). If you don't have time to read pick up the audio book. Forget about this legends stuff. I am not going to bash what they are doing, i am old and bias, but what ever the reason i really do like the old story line and characters better. There are literally 30 years of stories and about 100 novels. This series is what started most of it. Do yourself a favor and read it. It is really goodMay the force be with you.",5,"US"

2017-02-15,"Heir to the Empire reintroduces us to our favourite classic Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker","Heir to the Empire reintroduces us to our favourite classic Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia in what is, in book terms, the trilogy that was to follow on from the original trilogy after the events of Return of the Jedi.Grand Admiral Thrawn is a sinister admiral in charge of what remains of the Empire, and uses his intelligence and incredible insight to know what his targets are thinking at any given time. His humanoid form and glittering red eyes help add that menace that we need in a Star Wars villain. He even has a way of dealing with opponents who have the Force, which makes him an enemy to reckon with. In the aftermath of the Empire’s defeat, the New Republic is already being divided by ambitious politicians seeking power. Leia has suffered assassination attempts by strange aliens, Luke is being hunted by a fiery tempered bounty hunter, and Han is just the same old Han.The author had the character expressions and voices spot on: ‘Threepio’s attempts to be simultaneously helpful, inquisitive, and polite never quite came off. Not without looking vaguely comical anyway.’ The action scenes were brief and thrilling without too much backstory or complex terms.There were a few references to events in the original trilogy and some scenes were a little too reminiscent of events in the film, but at least it showed that the research had been done properly and it gave the book an authentic feeling of belonging to the original trilogy, which I can’t say for certain with the prequel trilogy following The Phantom Menace. In fact, I suspect some ideas in The Phantom Menace had been borrowed from Heir to the Empire, such as Leia giving birth to twins and a sentence spoken later in the story ‘to you and your Republic we owe a life debt’.I would definitely read the sequel Dark Force Rising, and recommend others looking for Star Wars books to dive into this one. It’s authentic and very good.",4,"US"
2017-02-11,"You only THINK you've read Heir to the Empire","It's something of a crime that I had to buy this directly from the author as it's out of print.  (On the plus side, it's autographed!)  Not that I haven't read Heir to the Empire multiple times, but the annotated edition was completely worth the effort to obtain.  The commentary from Zahn and from his editor are alternately amusing and insightful, especially Zahn laying out, step by step, the characteristics of a good commander as Grand Admiral Thrawn demonstrates them in-story.  The only disappointment was reading comments on a section and thinking ""I wonder what he'll say about--"" and realize the scene I'm thinking of is in ""Dark Force Rising"" or ""The Last Command"".  I would happily pay for hardback editions of the complete annotated Thrawn Trilogy.And a major bonus in this version is the novella ""Crisis of Faith"", which sadly doesn't appear to have been reprinted anywhere else.  (It might make a nice surprise for purchasers of the new-canon novel Thrawn?)  It's almost unique among Star Wars fiction in that it functions nearly outside the main universe--it's an excellent science fiction story where the heroes happen to be Imperials from the Star Wars universe, but you could almost remove those references and never notice.  It's a shame that it's only available in this edition.",5,"US"
2017-03-25,"Best Star Wars series i ever read.","Back in the 90s  I read the the ttrilogy .  After its release.  Zahn is a great author ,  The story takes place about 5 years after the events Return of the Jedi. Thats not what i wanted to talk about. Its more of the way the book was written. Zahn put a lot of detain into the each part of the story. On each page. The first part of the book towards the beginning of the story talks briefly about the Battle of endor. It only mentions the destruction of the Executor how it crashed into the Death star and disintegrated. And the desrtructon of the death star.  Admiral thrawn is later introduced in the first few pages if the book. With a bit of a description of the character. Its more how well the plot is written in each chapter, As you read each chapter you expect more to happen till the end of the story. The book is full of climaxes. The ever on going conflict between the empire and the rebellion.  THe book ends in a cliff hanger of what is to come later on in the series. It makes you want to read the whole series. Thats the fun of reading Trilogies. The cliff hanger endings in between each story.",5,"US"
2016-08-15,"The best of the Legends","Heir to the Empire is just as good as most fans will tell you--an exciting, well-written and very interesting Star Wars novel. It's really compelling to see exactly what Luke, Leia and Han are up to after the destruction of the Second Death Star (even though these events are no longer canon); they keep growing as characters, especially Leia, who is slowly learning how to be a Jedi.But as you may imagine, the most interesting character is Thrawn--there's a reason why he has been ""recanonized"" and is about to make his debut in Star Wars Rebels, as well as making an appearance in a new Timothy Zahn novel. He's a compelling, complex and very intimidating character, an Imperial officer who I'm sure will continue to be developed in the next two books of the Trilogy. Can't wait to read them!",5,"US"

2016-08-04,"With Heir to the Empire he rekindled the public's love for Star Wars and as a result allowed for ...","This was the book that really started it all. Yes, the  original Expanded Universe really began with Splinter of the Minds Eye and the old Marvel comic books, but Heir to the Empire was and is the reason why we still have Star Wars tie-in novels to this day. I'm even willing to wager that without this book, there would not be a Force Awakens.Back in the early 90's, the original Star Wars trilogy of films had by then wrapped up. Minor interest to the series was generally put out in the form of toys and rumors of the prequel movies that had years yet to come out. Timothy Zahn changed all that. With Heir to the Empire he rekindled the public's love for Star Wars and as a result allowed for numerous new books such as the Jedi Academy trilogy, the Bounty Hunter Wars, the X-Wing Series, the Corellian and Black Fleet Crisis trilogies, and even everything from the Young Jedi Knights to the Fate of the Jedi to be created. Of course all the aforementioned stories are now labeled as Legends (which I don't have a major issue with as I understand why it had to be done) and are now non-canon, but that does not mean these books, especially those of Timothy Zahn's, are to be ignored or forgotten. This book is in fact more relevant now than ever because of the release of the new movies and the introduction of Thrawn into the Rebels tv series and also that, back in the day, Heir to the Empire was considered by many to be THE Episode VII.Anyway, enough from me on the importance of the book, lets get to the review. The writing is superb. Timothy Zahn makes it seem effortless in his character descriptions. You really get inside each one's mentality and it really fleshes them out. He also is fantastic with his diction and his imagery. Star Wars is a very grounded sic-fi fantasy with a ton of detail to be noted of. Zahn repeatedly reminds you that what you are reading is first and foremost a star wars story. Everything he writes here you easily picture in a Star Wars movie, that both includes the familiar and the new stuff that he himself came up with. Which brings me to the characters themselves. Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, Lando, 3P0, R2, and slew of other familiar faces make their triumphant return after 5 years since the Battle of Endor. Zahn pays very careful attention to each of these established characters and knows exactly how to write each one of them. While reading, you can most certainly believe that these are the characters you fell in love with in the films. However, Zahn also brings new characters to the table. The most notable of which are the bad guys. First off is Thrawn, the genius military tactician and Grand Admiral of the Imperial Remnant. He commands his forces with wisdom and respect, taking care not waste any men or resources like Vader would. While not a force user, everything he does is carefully planned out allowing him to carefully deconstruct his opponents' each and every move, making him always one step ahead of the heroes. He is scary intelligent and it makes for a highly compelling villain.The next most notable is Mara Jade. A fan favorite, Mara Jade is a former Imperial assassin and Dark Jedi (yes a Dark Jedi, not a Sith, there's a difference) whom has taken up a life as smuggler and holds a personal vendetta against Luke Skywalker. This character goes through a major arc, discovering herself and what she truly stands for. She's no damsel in distress or Mary Sue, but she knows (or at least she thinks she does) what it is that she wants and she's determined to get it. Then there's Joruus C'Baoth. This guy is probably the most mysterious out of all of them, and by far the most colorful at the same time. I don't want to spoil this one so I'll just say he is a very, very troubled former Jedi. Now I do have one minor complaint. This is the only con I can think of. The book is sometimes very slow. Don't get me wrong, there's great action and great dialogue, but this book suffers from having to introduce us to all these new characters, places, and situations. At points it can be a little much, but at the same time it kind of has to do these lengthy introductions. This is the first book in a trilogy mind you, and it gets much better as it goes along. Also a fairly large amount of time has passed between the events of Return of the Jedi and the events of this book.Anyhow its a great read and well worth your time and appreciation. On a side note, I highly suggest that after reading this version that you pick up the hardcover anniversary edition. Zahn took the liberty of annotating his own text and has some very cool things to say and enlighten you of.",5,"US"
2017-11-06,"Amazing Book","One of my favorite books of all time, but sadly it is not considered to be part of the Star Wars canon universe. Heir to the Empire is not only the first book of an amazing trilogy it is the first book for the Star Wars Expanded Universe (not counting Splinter of a Mind's Eye). Heir to the Empire takes place 5 years after the events of Return of the Jedi and brings back our heroes. The Empire is losing against the newly created New Republic. However the Empire is taken over by Grand Admiral Thrawn. A high ranking Chiss tactician. Throughout the book Thrawn always seems to be one step ahead of our heroes, and it seems likely that the Empire will return to its full glory. This was my first Star Wars Legends book and I highly recommend this to any Star Wars fan, especially any that are interested in more than the movies. Thrawn was recently brought back to canon and his story is still a work in progress, and this book is a good way to find out more about him. The book is also and amazing starting point for the Legends timeline, several books mention the events that take place in this trilogy. I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did.",5,"US"
2014-05-24,"An Important Beginning to the Star Wars Expanded Universe","By 1991 the Star Wars series had been in a carbonite type deep freeze.  Return of the Jedi had come out eight years earlier, and in the interim Star Wars fans were tossed mere scraps, including two laughable made for television Ewok films.  If you wanted a decent Star Wars story between 1983 and 1991, then you pretty much had to start writing fan fiction.  Aside from the actual quality of Heir to the Empire, I think its reception, then and now, is clearly colored by the fact that when published in 1991 the novel served as a veritable oasis at a time when fans of Star Wars had been trudging through the desert.  That might seem like hyperbole, but not only has Heir to the Empire made it on just about everyone’s list of best stories from the Star Wars Extended Universe, but the entire trilogy was also voted onto the list of NPR’s 100 greatest sci-fi and fantasy novels.  (It beat out Ray Bradbury’s The Illustrated Man!)  While I’m not sure Heir to the Empire qualifies as one of the greatest sci-fi/fantasy stories of all time, I can understand why people hold the book in such high regard.  Zahn has a real talent for creating new characters who fit within the Star Wars galaxy while also writing old favorites in ways that make them believable simulacrums of our celluloid heroes.But the story begins not with Luke, Han, and Leia; it begins with Grand Admiral Thrawn, a red eyed, blue skinned Chiss who, after the demise of Emperor Palpatine five years earlier at Endor, has taken over the remaining imperial forces in the outer rim.  In a retcon to the films, the Empire is represented as racist (speciesist?), preferring to promote only humans into the ranks of the upper echelon.  On the one hand, considering that the work of Leni Riefenstahl and the Third Reich form the visual template for the Empire, this makes a certain amount of sense.  But considering the vast diversity of species within the Star Wars Universe, and considering the films never hinted at this policy, it seems somewhat counterproductive.  Still, the fact that Thrawn achieved the Empire’s highest command despite this policy of discrimination tells us a little about his skill as a leader and tactician.Questionable retconing aside, Thrawn is a wonderful villain for our heroes.  Where Vader was quick to anger and would execute underlings at a steady clip, Thrawn is reserved, mindful.  When not occupying the bridge of his Star Destroyer, he’s often in his quarters studying hologram images of art created by different species from a myriad of different worlds.  Of course, he’s doing this in order to better understand the culture of these people so that he can get inside their heads and understand how to defeat them.  In the tradition of the erudite villain, like Hannibal Lecter, Thrawn can appreciate both tactics and aesthetics.  Part of Thrawn’s scheme to reassert the Empire as the central power in the galaxy involves recruiting Joruus C’baoth, an insane cloned Jedi master.  In order to convince C’baoth to aid him, Thrawn collects a bunch of small lizard-like creatures, the ysalamirir, which have the power to dampen a Jedi’s use of the force.  He also promises C’baoth that he will deliver Luke, Leia, and the twins Leia is currently pregnant with.Of course, all these machinations are unknown to Luke Skywalker and the now married Leia and Han Solo.  They’re busy attempting to rebuild the New Republic, which also appears to be teetering on the brink thanks to political infighting and a lack of resources.  Han Solo is tasked with recruiting smugglers into legitimate shipping operations for the new government, but because it’s not clear how long the New Republic will last, many of these illegal operators are wary of taking any sides so long as the Empire is still a power player.  Zahn does a wonderful job of capturing the voice of not only the three main characters but also of secondary characters like Lando Calrissian and C3PO.  Even Admiral Akbar and Wedge Antilles make appearances.  But he’s especially great at capturing Han’s sardonic charms, something that’s not easy to mimic.The book is well plotted and has the easy momentum of a snowspeeder on Hoth.  As the protagonists attempt to unravel the mystery of who is attempting to kidnap Luke and Leia, Thrawn is drawing them and the fledgling Republic into further traps.  I don’t want to give away too much plot, but Thrawn’s plans come to a head on Mykyr, the planet where he collected the ysalimiri and home to the criminal operations of smuggler Talon Karrde.  Karrde is another great creation by Zahn.  As a smuggler with a code—he appears to have a sense of duty towards anyone he views as his guests—he fits nicely within the Star Wars galaxy.  Likewise, Karrde’s mysterious underling, Mara Jade, appears to hold a burning grudge against Luke Skywalker for reasons that even Karrde is unaware of.Perhaps the only drawback during this section of the novel is that because of the ysalimiri, Luke is without the powers of the Force.  I can only imagine the disappointment of fans who waited eight years since Return of the Jedi in order to read about Luke swashbuckling across worlds as a full fledged Jedi Knight, only to have the author take away those powers.  The ysalimiri are a somewhat dubious plot device to begin with (they’re strangely reminiscent of the controversial midichlorians from the prequel films), but using them as Luke’s kryptonite somewhat deflates the novel’s action and adventure.There are a few other aspects of the book that are creakily constructed.  Despite C’baoth being positioned early in the novel as integral to Thrawn’s schemes, he does very little throughout the course of the story.  (Although, to be fair, a good portion of the novel is setting up elements for later in the trilogy.)  Leia does not get much attention, and she’s essentially shuffled off to the Wookie planet of Kashyyyk where she’s forgotten for a long stretch (a chapter following Leia even ends on a cliffhanger that isn’t resolved until much later in the story).  There’s a little more retconning here and there that, as someone who’s protective of the original trilogy, I could have done without.  For instance, the novel suggests that Emperor Palpatine used the Force in order to increase the performance of his men during the battle of Endor.  (Was he also doing this while simultaneously attempting to turn Luke to the darkside?)  The prose is mostly serviceable, and while this makes for easy, fast-paced reading, it would have been interesting to see how an author might try to remake George Lucas’s visual palette into language.Still, for those hungering for Star Wars adventures beyond the films, Heir to the Empire may very well be the perfect place to start.  Zahn does more than give us adventures with our favorite characters in a galaxy far, far away; he adds invaluable characters, places and concepts to this world.  Without a doubt, Heir to the Empire shows what creative minds can further conjure beyond the original trilogy.",4,"US"
2011-09-13,"JUST as good--if not a little better--than it was 20 years ago.","This was the novel which seriously lit a match underneath the base of Star Wars fans eager for more from that galaxy far, far away. While it was far from being the first novel outside the original 3 books based on the movies (I believe that honor goes to 'Splinter of the Mind's Eye') but Heir To The Empire was easily the best--and not simply by a small margin, either. It was leaps & bounds ahead of literally everything else in print at that time, and one could argue that it still remains the best.What Timothy Zahn did better than everyone was capture completely the pure 'essence' of what the Star Wars Universe actually was. Let me explain what that means to me: Star Wars novels are essentially a dime-a-dozen these days, and some are better than others. Some feature characters with the names Luke, Han & Leia, but they don't really capture the *feel* of those people we've all come to know over the decades. Mr. Zahn portrayed them (IMO) with absolute precision. Every word uttered by C3PO seemed to be exactly what he would've said knowing how neurotic he is...and same goes for Luke, Leia and everyone else. But all of that would have been a waste if Zahn hadn't crafted a complex and brilliant story that went right along with it.One more area where 'Heir' shined was in the addition of 'New' characters which at once automatically fit perfectly into the Expanded Universe as though they had always been there, somewhere in the background. Talon Karrde, Mara Jade and of course, the greatest Protagonist in the Star Wars Universe: Grand Admiral Thrawn (again, IMO). Their popularity can be measured in how other authors have continued to use them continually (although not nearly as good). Is it true that the home of the Republic/Empire/Rebellion, Coruscant was named by Zahn and not Lucas? Honestly, I'm not sure, but I'd like to think it was. I only wish that Lucas had the common sense to have included some of the brilliant story arcs which could have made the prequels even a little better. The addition of the Ysalimiri are simply amazing and creative in the extreme. The only thing that makes their inclusion better is how they end up being used in the sequels 'Dark Force Rising' and 'The Last Command'.While Timothy Zahn's status as the greatest Star Wars Author in print may be debatable, what isn't was his Instant Impact on the fans 20 years ago as 'Heir' first became available. What makes purchasing the 20th Anniversary Edition absolutely WORTH it happen to be two-fold: First you have Zahn's notes in the margins of almost every page explaining why certain things were included and why among many other insights into the creation of this amazing novel. Second is the addition of the fairly large novella at the end featuring Thrawn, 'Crisis of Faith'. That story alone is almost worth the price of the book itself.In short: for fans of Timothy Zahn and his Star Wars novels, this is a wonderful reminder of why we loved the original three films so much over the years. For those who haven't picked up this book but thought about it: Just Do It, as Nike says. You won't be disappointed. In my opinion, Heir To The Empire and both the sequels are as good or BETTER than the first three original films and stand as my favorite in the Star Wars Universe hands down. Thanks again to Mr. Zahn for giving us fans such a wonderful present.",5,"US"
2018-10-16,"Well, well.............well.","As a Star Wars fan, i was SO excited to read this trilogy, it`s supposed to be the best foray into the SW Expanded Universe/Legends Universe, and i liked Thrawn A LOT from his appeareance in Star Wars Rebels, to the point i decided to buy this book and the sequel without even thinking, somehow my mind bought ALL the hype.However, i was left with a lackluster experience! The prose is terrible, the characterization is REALLY mediocre, it does feel like the Original Trilogy in the sense that most of the plot is basically a copy of the structure of each story, now i cant even understand HOW this is supposed to be the best Star Wars novel, and after reading this i can`t understand how fans complaint about the way TFA and TLJ took elements from the OT when this does the same and in SUCH a bad way, i`m puzzled about this book and the reaction the fandom has to it. This book has the same quality as some fics ive read in 2005 in the site fanfiction.net, which probably has a better offering in terms of content and creativity, and also the prose because GOOD LORD why does he use ""sardonically"" so much??My eye is jumping with stress at the mere thought of reading the sequel just because i bought it already, oh well, at least the cover is pretty!

2015-12-25,"I Don't Get the Hype","2.5/5 StarsIf you're interested in explored the Star Wars Expanded Universe, and do a little research on the topic, all you will find is dozens of ""Best Of"" lists putting Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy on the number 1 spot. Fans almost unanimously consider this trilogy to be the zenith of the EU. Now, the next two books are very, very good...but Heir to the Empire feels like a placeholder until we get to the good stuff.Nothing ever really seems to take off in this story. We are introduced to new characters and re-introduced to old ones. The plot itself is relatively interesting but nothing about it jumps out as particularly thrilling. Zahn's writing just feels rather stale and by the numbers, like he's trying his best to lay about all the cards as easily as possible while making sure to let you know ""hey this is Star Wars! See, see! It's the Star Wars you want!""He does a few things right. The villains are by far the most interesting thing in the novel and the things Zahn seems to have put the most effort into. The old gang, as it were, seems rather two-dimensional and hollow in comparison. Zahn doesn't seem to put his own personal touch into Luke, Han, Leia etc...he just gives us a thin version of what he thinks we want them to be like.Mara Jade and Talon Karrde are interesting new characters that only get better in the sequel books and the pacing of the story picks up and becomes a little more entertaining once Leia and Chewie go to Kasyyyk. Other than that, this is the very definition of a mediocre book. It's legendary status among fans in baffling to me to be honest. But hey, obviously I'm in the extreme minority, so give the book a go for yourself.",3,"US"
2013-09-30,"Re-ignite the Star Wars Flame","20 years ago, I was just a kid in a B. Dalton Bookstore (do those even exist anymore?!) on Christmas break visiting my grandparents in Phoenix. There, like a beacon of light on the bookshelf was a Star Wars book that looked awesome. The cover had Skywalker with his lightsaber drawn and an awesome looking old guy (Jorus). I had been a fan of the Star Wars movies and always wanted more but the older Marvel comics and the bad early books (Splinter of the Mind's Eye) just never did it for me. From the second I cracked open Heir to the Empire, I was hooked. It re-ignited the Star Wars flame inside of me and it has not burned out since, even though the new movies were pretty terrible.Heir to the Empire was one of the first Star Wars books to pop out and really start the flood of books that would eventually come. It is the first part of an epic trilogy that picks up years after the destruction of the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi and revisits Luke, Han, Leia, and the rest of the old crew as they fight the remnants of the Empire who are now lead by Grand Admiral Thrawn. The story is artfully crafted by a fellow fan of Star Wars, Timothy Zahn who has been my favorite author if Star Wars books. I had the pleasure of meeting him in Arizona with the release of his newer Star Wars book and he is a fan to the core, and it shows in his writing.If you like Star Wars and you like reading, pick up Heir to the Empire, but don't buy the anniversary edition, it has annotations that spoil the plot of this trilogy if you have not read it before. Go find a paperback or hardback at a used bookstore. You won't regret it. If you have read the trilogy before, the 20th anniversary edition provides great insight into the crafting of the characters and the story and is worth a second read-through.",5,"US"
2013-06-04,"Surprise! This holds up 20 years later.","Twenty years ago, I eagerly devoured these books. At the time, Star Wars was over and there were no toys, comics, or movies on the horizon. This was a neat throwback to my childhood favorite, but I soon discarded it because of the things that bothered me at the time: the omniscient chess master of a villain, the mysterious femme fatale, and way too many callbacks like ""I have a bad feeling about this."" I donated my old hardcovers to the local library.Earlier this year, I tried the audiobook of ""Scoundrels,"" also by Timothy Zahn, and the entertaining reading opened my eyes to he older books in the series. Marc Thompson performs a one-man theatrical reading of the book, bringing fun, unique voices to each character. My favorite is his Distinguished Southern Gentleman impression of Billy Dee Williams (Lando). He also gives a Ricardo Montalban ""Rich Corinthian Leather"" reading to Talon Karrde, a new character. It's silly, but it works.Thompson also nails Harrison Ford's Midwestern bray (Han Solo) as well as the Californian meditative Jedi as portrayed by Mark Hamill (as Luke Skywalker). Various posh accents (Thrawn, Winter, Mon Mothma) and the ""harrumph harrumph"" of Pellaeon are delightful as well.So how's the book today? Perhaps the prequels have lowered my standards, but Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, and Talon Karrde are more memorable than Count Dooku, Jar Jar, or the other doofuses in Episodes I and II. I still think Mara Jade's backstory is badly presented, and we are frequently told but not shown how smart Thrawn can be (clearly, he's been reading ahead). It would not make a good Star Wars film, but would be passable as a Game of Thrones-style miniseries. As a one-man radio play, it's a winner.

Overall it does have a similar feel to the Star Wars films and is a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe. Princess Leia and Han Solo are married and the book explores the idea of Jedis having twins. A new character is introduced, Grand Admiral Thrawn, who is now in control of the Imperial fleet. While the original film trilogy is undoubtedly superior to this novel, it does explore the favored trio of Skywalker, Solo and Leia in a logical and compelling way. You could almost consider it Star Wars VII. Though some reviewers complain that certain details from the movies have been changed, those things are minor as the novel retains the logic of the film franchise. The book leads up to an action-packed showdown. If you are Star Wars crazy (for Episodes IV, V, VI), check out Heir to the Empire. It's hard to put my finger on it but I didn't find the book as enjoyable as it could have been. Perhaps being in the Star Wars universe is difficult to live up but I would prefer to see another film with Skywalker, Solo and Leia.",3,"US"
2013-02-28,"Strange review of a strange reading experience","While the next round of ""Star Wars"" films probably won't adapt Timothy Zahn's pretty well-regarded ""Grand Admiral Thrawn"" trilogy of years past, they may make a few nods to some of the occurrences in them (like the twins born to Han Solo and Princess Leia a few years after the events in ""Return of the Jedi"", for example). For that reason I thought I'd finally give the first of the books, ""Heir to the Empire"", a whirl after it's been available for so many years.My thoughts? I enjoyed it, but maybe not as wildly as others. I missed the kind of swashbuckling action, dark drama, and sweeping romance of the original trilogy of films, finding the book a little heavy on nitty-gritty political intrigue and technical jargon.  Make no mistake, the book had ""Star Wars""-style action and drama, but it was often diluted by that other stuff.  I mean, what's supposed to be an exciting escape scene in space doesn't necessarily benefit from pages and pages of description about how a tractor beam works.I also found it strange that the Empire (or what's left of it) was now being run by an admiral (Thrawn) aboard a star destroyer.  Shouldn't there be some kind of seat of government somewhere from which the admirals get their orders?  That's kind of nit-picky, I admit, but it bothered me.It was also weird to see iconic characters like Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia being given all kinds of new character traits and opinions about things.  It's almost liked Timothy Zahn worked too hard on them, to the point where they didn't feel like good old Han, Luke, and Leia anymore.  Again, another strange criticism, I know.I'll probably continue on with the rest of Zahn's trilogy, as I got enough mild enjoyment out of the first book, I guess.  I certainly didn't find it boring, which is the worse sin a story can commit.  And many people loved these novels when they first appeared in the 90's, after years of no new ""Star Wars"" stories after ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983.  I think the problem for me is that, in the end, the whole thing will probably turn out to be a very good science-fiction adventure, but not necessarily a very good ""Star Wars"" science-fiction adventure.  We'll see.",3,"US"
2015-04-27,"A great backlog story.","This book is responsible for the Star Wars revival in the 1990s, giving it a plethora of high praise from all around. However, reading the novel in 2015 gives a different vibe. I read this book in prep for The Force Awakens, just to see what the expanded universe was like post ROTJ before it was erased. Zahn is a great author and the writing is superb. Grand Admiral Thrawn and Mara Jade are definitely characters that stand out in the novel and I wish could make it back into the new expanded universe. Apart from those two characters, the story follows the original film cast and also deals with the struggling New Republic and the defeated Empire fighting for dominance in the galaxy. I enjoying the majority of the book with the exception of Leia’s storyline and the Jedi Master clone that is introduced only to play a small part in the overall plot of the book. A very interesting and fun read for those curious about the old expanded storylines, but not a recommended story for new readers.",4,"US"
2011-09-10,"This is the book you're looking for..","20 Years ago, in a book store far, far away....Twenty years ago, Bantam Spectra, Lucasfilm, and Timothy Zahn brought the thrill and excitement of Star Wars to the printed page.  While Mr. Zahn did not create the Expanded Universe, if his first book had failed, we would have a radically different world of Star Wars publishing and likely a much more limited one.  The adult Star Wars novels are one of the central pillars of the Expanded Universe and it was Heir to the Empire that really re-launched Star Wars publishing.How does the 20th Anniversary Edition of Heir to the Empire stack up against the original release?  The Anniversary Edition weighs in at 411 pages to the original editions 361, this is due to the annotations, the annotations are set on the outside margins of each page, the main body of text is narrower then in a traditional hardcover release meaning we get less text per page resulting in the 50 extra pages.The Anniverary Edtion also includes a Foreword by Howard Roffman, President, Lucas Licensing, an introduction by Timothy Zahn, an afterword by HttE's original editor Betsy Mitchell, and a brand new novella by Timothy Zahn entitled Crisis of Faith.The presentation of the book is terrific.  The dust jacket features a metallic silver cover with darkened striations across it.  There is an embossed Imperial Cog logo in the center, the embossed text is a mixture of blacks and reds, particularly impressive is the subtitle ""Heir to the Empire,"" where the top of the letters are black and the bottoms are red.  The interior of the dust flaps is black with silver text.Underneath the dust jacked the cover of the book has a black and white copy of the original cover art printed directly on the cardboard, minus the front and back cover text.  There is still text on the spine and the overall finish looks like one of the shiny school text books.The annotations are numbered within each chapter, but not cumulatively through the book.  As such each chapter begins with #1 and continues up depending on how many notes are in that particular chapter.The only thing really missing is a glossary for the annotations.  It would be cool to go to the back of the book and find the exact page for an annotation regarding a particular character or event.The overall effect is a slightly different reading experience because there is a lot more white space on the page then the reader is used to traditionally.  I did find that while I was reading it was easy to miss the superscript number indicating where a footnote fits into the story.  This is both good and bad in that it is unobtrusive in the reading experience, but may take the annotation out of context if you read it after finishing the main body of text before turning to the next page.  I also noticed at least one occasion where multiple annotations where printed on the page after the annotation superscript appears because a previous annotation was so large it consumed all of the margin.Crisis of Faith is a meaty 52 page novella, the rather alien beginning of which made me re-read the first page a few times before I got into the story.  It features some new characters as well as a character that made his debut in Zahn's latest novel Choices of One.  There are some scenes that remind me of  A New Hope aboard the Death Star with Grand Moff Tarkin meeting with Imperial military commanders  There is also a good bit of action, some familiar minor characters getting a chance at the spotlight, and of course a healthy dose of Thrawn's brilliance in a military engagement.  It is an interesting book because of where it is set in the timeline, but we get a cast that is to the best of my reckoning entirely made up of EU characters.There are two very interesting new aliens in this book that have an interesting decision to make as to whether they should obey and conform to their superiors wishes, or whether they should do what they think maybe right.  I would be interesting in hearing about what happens to them in the future.  In the end Crisis of Faith is like much of Zahn's recent work, it provides another layer of connects his various stories, and adds depth to some characters and concepts we have seen developed in a limited sense in books like the Hand of Thrawn Duology and Choices of One.  If you haven't enjoyed Zahn's work since the Thrawn Trilogy or Hand of Thrawn Duology, then you probably won't get into this story.  But if you have enjoyed Zahn's recent work, or if you simply are a Star Wars Expanded Universe completest, then it is worth a read.Should you buy Heir to the Empire: 20th Anniversary Edition?  That's a good question.  The book comes with a cover price of $30 dollars which to the best of my knowledge is the most expensive price charged for a Star Wars hardcover novel to date.  The book is absolutely gorgeous, the novel has a classic story, the chance to get a DVD commentary track like experience in a novel is well, a novel concept.  I think it is well worth a purchase especially considering that you should be able to find it for much cheaper then cover price.  For example Amazon currently has it for sale for $17.14 with free shipping on orders over $25.  One thing to also keep in mind is that the decision as to whether or not we will see the same anniversary treatment with annotations for Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, will depend on sales of the this book.  Mr. Zahn is said that he is interested in doing such editions for each of those books, but in the end it all depends on sales for the publisher.If audiobooks are more your speed, then you should be happy  to know that Random House is releasing the book in that format as well, both as a CD audiobook($45) and as a audiobook download($22.50).  You can listen to a preview of the audiobook version of the story at Random House's HttE page.If you are a casual Star Wars fan or know a casual Star Wars fan and are looking for a place to put your toe into the water of the Expanded Universe, Heir to the Empire is and has always been my recommended jumping off point.LightsaberRattling.com",5,"US"
2017-02-03,"Curiosity satisfied but not enough to follow through","I liked it, but there are so many star wars books written by zhan, that I had hoped they'd all follow each other, but they don't exactly. I ended up frustrated reading this series. Even though HTTE is bk1, I  bought the other 2 in the series too, and after painfully reading book 1 and half of book 2, gave up on cracking the spine of the 3rd. The story is well written, don't get me wrong. Die hard SW fans will undoubtedly enjoy the series, but I got bored and lost interest, skipping pages, then whole chapters looking for that grab that won't let go....didn't get that. I think 3 stars is fair considering I didn't hate it, but can't say I loved it either. I liked the first book and parts of the second. The storyline dynamics of Han and Leia and their continuing story intrigued me. Satisfied my curiosity, but not enough to continue. Thanks for the read.",3,"US"
2013-09-12,"Thrawn makes it worth the read.","With promise of more movies on the horizon I decided it was high time I started this trilogy. This first installment was a good start, reasonably capturing the personalities of beloved characters and introducing a complex villain in Grand Admiral Thrawn. While I'm sure criticism often throws out serialized novels as literary compost, this series already proves itself an entertaining journey. And as a first installment it was absolutely good. While I have not read other Star Wars offshoots, all of my friends who have rated this one as the best by far.This is not to imply it is perfect. Zahn dragged out the big reveal of Mara Jade's backstory a little too long, which made me want to throw her in front of a Stormtrooper or out an airlock. As well, some of the character dialog borrowed too heavily from the movies, making me wonder if I should turn it into a ""I have a bad feeling about this"" drinking game. The most annoying aspect however, is the abrupt end with ""to be continued."" That works considerably better in comic books than it does in novels.Overall, it still was an enjoyable read not only for the beloved characters but the promise of more strategic maneuvers from Thrawn.",3,"US"
2012-03-28,"Should have been made into a star wars movie","I have read many Star Wars books, I've started with Truce at Bakura and have chronologically read up to here.  I understand that this book was first and won't fault all the things that don't add up perfectly not the Star Wars cannon, there's really only a few.The story for this one is Leia who is know married to Han and is expecting twins is now three months along along the way, is still sent out on diplomatic missions, there's not enough trained yet for her to step down.  Luke want to work more with his sister in teaching her how to use the force.  Upon one of the diplomatic missions Leia is attempted to get taken by a grey alien race that is not on file in the alien data base.A side mission has Han try to talk to his old smuggler buddies to try to get them to smuggle for the republic.Grand Admiral Thrawn is the best new character, he is a logical leader whose not trying to score victories but win the war.  He very calculating and expects the best from his crew.  Upon finding the Emperor's weapons cache, he meet a Jedi that has gone over to the dark side.  He seeks his help and in return he promises him Luke, Leia, and her unborn twins, in exchange for him helping guide his troops with the force.  Controlling a dark Jedi could be more than Thrawn can handle, the dynamic that these characters play off each other is really interesting they are each playing a chess match with their words and actions.I read a couple of these reviews, and although the vallhari force repelling animals that Thrawn use to repel the dark Jedi force, and keep Luke powerless when on the Karde's Planet, are described some what stupidly as furry snakes with legs.  The aspect of luke and the dark Jedi on an even playing field with mere mortal was fascinating, the chapters where Luke is powerless with Mara Jade in the forest, and you know Mara Jade as made it apartment that she wants to kill him was great.Mara Jade has a really interesting reveal of why she wants to kill Luke Skywalker that I hope is expand in the second book of the trilogy.I highly recommend if your a star wars lover that wants to expand off of the original story then this is the book for you",5,"US"
2016-01-07,"was actually pretty good. It's not great","This novel, the first of a 20-year-old trilogy paralleling the events of the first three Star Wars movies, was actually pretty good. It's not great. It's not especially well-written, but it succeeds in taking some beloved characters a few years removed from their on-screen activities and tossing them into a new adventure. I can see why it was a runaway bestseller which spawned an entire universe of Star Wars novels occurring before, during, and after the movie timeline.That said, I can also see why Disney is likely tossing it aside as it prepares to release Episode 7. It's a fun story with fun characters, but nothing that occurs in it, save possibly for the progeny of Han and Leia, is worth crafting a future around.So, the short of the book is that a secret genius Grand Admiral (Thrawn) and a secret crazy Jedi (Joruus C'baoth) and a secret force-using Emperor's gal Friday ""Hand"" (Mara Jade) survived the nominal end of the Empire and, five years later, are involved in various ways in the interaction between the New Republic and what's left of the Empire. Leia and Han are married, and she's very pregnant. Luke is a directionless Jedi. Everyone else (Lando, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3P0, Wedge etc.) is roughly the same.Throw all that into a blender and you get a fun little tale which roughly parallels Episode 4, right down to the catchphrases.And that's where things go south. I get it, everyone likes to say, ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" C3P0 is fluent in 6 million forms of communication and likes to tell everyone about that ability. Han really wants you to trust him and his crooked smile, even though now he's thoroughly trustworthy. I just get the sense reading this that Zahn wasn't comfortable making the source material his own, so he leaned upon old standbys in the hopes that it would help move books. So it's death by reference.Also, for some reason Zahn likes his non-Imperial characters, nearly all of them at one instance or another, to say, ""Point."" They mean ""Yes, you have a point"" or ""That's a fair point"" or something similar, but it's just a distracting shortcut of Zahn's that for some reason really grated on me over the book and its sequels.All that said, Zahn sells the book. The story is solid; the intrigue is fun; and, frankly, any Star Wars book is generally a welcome read, or preferably, a welcome listen, especially unabridged.",3,"US"
2017-06-12,"Awesome book - but the narration is terrible!","I loved this book and I was so excited to see it as an audiobook, but wound up returning it within a few days of buying it.  The book is amazing - the text just as enthralling as it was the first time I read it.  But the voices are too wrong - Leia sounds insipid and weak, and her lines are read like she's a total ditz.  Han, on the other hand, sounds like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove. There is a vast gulf between Patrick Warburton and Harrison Ford, and the voices just don't work.  Get the book instead and skip the audio.",2,"US"
2014-01-17,"Review of the 20th anniversary edition","4 1/2 stars.I absolutely love it when authors and publishers decide to re-release books with annotations or other extras. For me, this commemorative edition was a wonderful addition to my Star Wars collection, perhaps because I previously had a used paperback copy, so I didn't mind buying a better copy. I found the annotations a neat ""behind the scenes"" look into the writing and publishing of the novel and wish that they annotated the rest of the trilogy ... it also comes with a bonus Thrawn short story also written by Mr. Zahn.Story:4 stars.I actually read this book last out of the Thrawn Trilogy and I remember thinking, ""I like the order I read it in better."" I guess after reading books 2 and 3, I had high expectations and was expecting more from the beginning. However I still enjoy the trilogy as a whole (Zahn introduced one of the most memorable Star Wars villains in Grand Admiral Thrawn) and it does have the distinction of being the books that jump started Star Wars expanded universe publishing.",5,"US"
2016-02-28,"What a Star Wars novel supposed to look like","I don’t even know where to start with my outright love for this book and Zahn’s writing. So many licensed books (and sequels) get things wrong. They’re out-of-character, uninventive, and a disrespect to the original story that inspired them. But this book gets it right. It develops familiar characters with dignity and gravity, and invents new, three-dimensional characters that carry a vast presence on the page.We see Luke Skywalker with the same quiet, serious conviction that defined his arc in Return of the Jedi, but facing new fears as he questions his ability to be the Jedi his masters were, with no one to teach him but his own instincts and grounded morality. We see Han Solo, still as wry and witty as ever, but with the added sense of responsibility for not only his new wife but his unborn children. Leia holds her own, under attack by mysterious assassins, while learning the ways of the Force and her new lightsaber (oh how I wish she would have still become a Jedi in the Disney canon…). Characters are not taken for granted and are written with introspective awareness of their own journeys and their own beliefs. This is everything a Star Wars book needs to be to do justice to the incredible characters that gave life to the original. I am in love.Zahn’s brilliant grasp on understanding a character’s core spills over into his new creations, Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the dark Jedi Joruus C’baoth. Foundational characters in the (now uncrowned) Star Wars Expanded Universe. And no wonder. None of them act out of simple hatred or rage, despite playing the “bad guys” of the story. He writes them with a surety of beliefs and conviction, clear and purposed goals, and complex motivations. They are people, with the nuances that come with that distinction.Zahn is effortless with the concepts that make this story as a whole so vastly well-rounded. He’s got military strategy down like an expert — Thrawn is a real commander, the kind that could lead a successful army in real life… the guy’s a genius tactician, psychologist, and a great leader. The dogfights and battles spark of tangible reality and down-to-earth strategics, with physics a very real presence in so many tactics employed by Luke and others. Zahn’s got economy, he’s got politics, he’s got a stunning imagination for fantastic, but scientifically-grounded world-building (such as Lando’s walking city).The details here aren’t arbitrary and we don’t get any lame references to nerf nuggets, hit singles, and throw-in-a-holo-prefix to create a world (sorry Heir to the Jedi is still my standard for a bad Star Wars novel). Instead, there’s logistics to Zahn’s worlds, unassuming uniqueness in his invention of terms and customs.And then there’s the plot and humor. Zahn’s sense of comedy is so low-key and situational. Somehow he makes grand tense scenes like the ones between Thrawn and C’baoth both full of bone fide suspense and dignity, and equal parts squabbling crack. It’s utterly brilliant. The plot doesn’t try to reach beyond itself or be too mind-blowing, but is based on a sense of logistics with the new Republic and the scraps of the old Empire. Han is out trying to recruit smugglers to aid the Republic shipping and economics. Thrawn is recruiting the dark Jedi C’baoth to mentally unify the fleet into efficiency (while planning for his big attack). Elements fall together with insane (and sometimes humorous) genius, and build up with suspense and mystery. It’s small scale enough to feel like the little people that populate Star Wars, epic enough to feel like the largest ILM battle sequences.The old Expanded Universe might have been scrapped, but to me this stuff is canon. It captures more of the heart and soul of the characters and the story of Star Wars than so many other books, and I only hope they use the template of deft characterization here to define what’s coming in the EU.",5,"US"
2011-09-08,"One of the most significant Star Wars stories--every fan should own","When Heir to the Empire came out in 1991, it changed the way most people looked at Star Wars.  This can't be overstated.  For most people in the early 90s, Star Wars had been reduced to a fad you fondly remembered in the 80s.  This book was the first domino that relaunched an international obsession with Star Wars that has lasted for, as the anniversary of this book indicates, two decades.  It has come to define the Star Wars Expanded Universe for an entire generation of fans.If only for that reason, Heir to the Empire is significant and deserves it's own special edition.  Beyond that, Heir to the Empire is an outstanding book in its own right.  Keeping in mind that this is a book about Star Wars, it's hard to imagine Heir to the Empire (and the Thrawn trilogy generally) doing a better job at what it does.  The characters are still familiar, but also matured; and matured in a natural, familiar way.  The plot is original and yet fits easily in the preconceived Star Wars universe, as do the new settings.  In short, the book captures the feel of Star Wars but presents that feel in a novel, fresh way.This is particularly impressive for a book predicated on a movie trilogy that was driven to a large extent by special effects.  Zahn's writing style is perfect for this genre, capturing the feel of space battles and Star Destroyer escapes in an exhilarating fashion.  When you read this book you feel like you can see the action unfolding.  In fact, many Star Wars fans in their moments of greatest honesty would admit that few (if any) Star Wars books after the Thrawn trilogy have so effectively captured the magic of Star Wars as Heir to the Empire did.  Even Zahn's own later contributions, while something to look forward to, have often felt lackluster in the shadow of this book.In short, every Star Wars fan should own a copy of Heir to the Empire; and if you don't already own one, why not own the 20th anniversary edition with all its additional bells and whistles?  I myself already own the original 1991 hardcover of this book but enjoy owning this version as well, given the special place this book holds in the history of Star Wars.  The annotations are a treat that make the additional expenditure worthwhile, as it's very rewarding to see the thought process behind the creation of one of the most significant stories in the Star Wars legendarium.",5,"US"
2014-05-31,"Interesting read from the very first page","If you look into these reviews you will see a common thread along the negative ones.-Thrawn (the antagonist) seems to know everything. He's more intelligent than the emperor and comes to near impossible conclusions concerning our protagonists activities.-Not enough descriptions given for settings, aliens, etc.This isn't going to be the best literary work you've ever read. Now that said, take it for what it is: a fast paced, entertaining read that doesn't allow itself to get bogged down too many details. If you are reading this, chances are you already know a thing or two about this universe, and descriptions on characters and settings are just going to get in the way. As for the protagonist seeming to be able to guess heroes every move, well... *shrugs... the author seems to recognize it and a bunch of the supporting characters keep wondering throughout the book, ""what would have happened at Endor if this guy had been there instead of the Emperor?""Overall, a great read. Not George Martin but these days that's not exactly a bad thing.",4,"US"
2012-03-28,"It's about time!","I always wondered why they never made an unabridged audiobook of these books and I am so grateful that someone finally made the effort before my old cassette tapes broke from overuse!I was so excited when these books were first released and own the original hardcovers, paperback, and cassette versions.  Timothy Zahn did an excellent job continuing the Star Wars world and I've always felt the Thrawn Trilogy was one of the reasons why George Lucas never made films 7-9,as he originally intended.I won't give away the plot, since hopefully many of you read these books years ago, but will focus on the differences between the cassette (abridged) and CD (unabridged) versions, since I suspect many shoppers were like me- wondering if it was worth buying yet ANOTHER version of these books. :)In my opinion, the answer is yes.  While I adore my original versions, read by ""Wedge Antilles"" Denis Lawson, I really missed all of the scenes and dialogue cut for the abridged versions.  So, while the different pronunciations of characters and places were a bit disconcerting at first, by the second and third listen, I was hooked.  Zahn's writing is just so good and the empathy I felt for these characters was so much faster getting the ""full picture"" as it is.I really hope they don't wait for the anniversary of the next two books in the trilogy before releasing an unabridged version.  I was impatient for each book 20 years ago, and that hasn't changed one bit!",4,"US"
2017-02-05,"I was certainly not disappointed! The main characters of the book are Luke ...","Ever since I really became a hardcore Star Wars fan, I was intensely interested in the character of Grand Admiral Thrawn-- even more so since he entered the Rebels franchise. I was just as interested in Timothy Zahn’s writing, and how he came about creating the Chiss species. I was certainly not disappointed!The main characters of the book are Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Han Solo on the Republic Side. In Imperial space, an ambitious commander (Grand Admiral Thrawn himself) is assisted by a human Captain Pellaeon and a disillusioned ex-Jedi Master named Joruus C’baoth. Overall, Zahn does a good job of giving them all equal amounts of attention-- though I would have liked to have a bit more insight into the going-ons of Thrawn and his subordinates. (This adds to the mystery of it all, though!) As the book gets rolling, we largely follow Luke on his misadventures across the galaxy, and close scrapes with death. The emotions and actions of each of the characters were realistic, and also reminiscent of the movies, keeping the “galaxy far, far away” feeling fresh in readers’ minds. At the same time, Zahn introduces alien elements (quite literally) into the story-- new species and planets-- whilst still keeping the universe alive and continuous.Of course, my favorite character was Thrawn. He is so spectacularly peculiar in the way he goes about commanding the Fleet, and his studying of art and tactics is engrossing. The choice to tell him through Pellaon’s eyes was a very interesting one.My only complaint would be that it does tend to drag in certain areas, and, if you’re not really up-to-date with military and Star Wars universe science, you might be a little bit lost and left behind. The intense detail is only a very minor issue, though, and Zahn’s flowing writing manages to gloss over it fairly well. All in all, it was a very nice read! And I will definitely be reading Dark Force Rising in the future someone soon-- as well as Outbound Flight. :)",4,"US"
2005-11-07,"Equal To The Movies!","""Heir To The Empire"" was the first Star Wars novel to come out back in the early 90s when the saga was revived through novels and comics.  It's not the first Chronologically to follow the movie ""Return Of The Jedi"" (that distinction goes to ""The Truce At Bakura"", and in my opinion either ""Heir"" or ""Truce"" make great starting points for anyone who's seen the movies but hasn't yet delved into the books) but it was the first published, so I've decided to do its writeup first.  If you want to start with ""The Truce At Bakura"" you might be better off not reading the rest of this, because ""Truce"" picks up immediately after ""Jedi"" while ""Heir"" takes place 5 years after that timeframe, and in talking about it it'll be necessary to say where the Star Wars Universe is at in that period of time.  Five years have passed since the death of the Emperor and the destruction of the second Death Star, but that momentous victory didn't signal the abrupt end of the Empire itself.  It did set in motion the Empire's rapid decline, and after five years the Empire finds itself boxed into an area a fifth the size of its former territory, while the Rebellion, now known as the New Republic, has liberated the rest of the Empire's territory.  Luke Skywalker has grown in the Force to where he's far more powerful than he was at the end of ""Jedi"", Han Solo and Leia Organa are married with young children (this all comes out in the first couple of chapters of the book; no spoilers), the Republic is beginning to fully flourish and prosper, and the once seemingly indomitable Empire is low on ships, low on troops, low on morale, and losing ground to the Republic at a constant basis.  Into this time of void for the Empire and growing revitalization for the rest of the galaxy comes Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn, one of several major new characters who make their debut in ""Heir"".  What's kept the expanding Star Wars Universe strong is that it's kept its characters from the movies (in some cases expanding their roles quite a bit, like with Admiral Ackbar, a feature character in some books) but it's continued adding new ones, actually adding new ones who come to be just as important as the movie players.  After the first ""Star Wars"" they didn't restrict themselves to having that movie's characters and that movie's characters only: they added Yoda, Lando Calrissian, gave us our first look at the Emperor, added new planets, vehicles, etc.  Same with ""Return Of The Jedi"" - enter the Ewoks (who I feel have been unjustly maligned), the Mon Calamari, a slew of new species and characters at Jabba's Palace and so on.  Likewise the prequel movies, years after the books started going again, didn't limit themselves to having just Obi-Wan, Annakin, Yoda, et al. when they were younger; enter Padme Naberrie, Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn, Jar Jar Binks, Count Dooku and a wealth of others.  The novels and comics have been successful in expanding the overall mythos of Star Wars most times out, not by diminishing the classic characters but by bringing in new, vital characters.  Thrawn is definately one of these.  A blue-skinned hybrid between a human and an unknown alien, Thrawn is brilliant and ruthless, but possessed of a magnetism that inspires loyalty and reinvigorates the demoralized Imperial forces.  Probably the greatest strategic mind the Empire ever produced, Thrawn spent the years of the original Star Wars movie trilogy far off on the outermost fringes of the galaxy, subduing what few systems had not already become part of the Empire.  The last of the Empire's twelve Grand Admirals, his return to the heart of the galaxy and subsequent assume of command of the remaining Imperial fleet manages to suddenly - and believably - turn the tide of battle significantly.  Thrawn immediately establishes himself as one of the great Star Wars villains, as impressive as the Emperor, Darth Maul, the Fetts, etc., possibly surpassed only by Darth Vader himself.  Of the many other characters introduced the other one who not only makes an immediate impact but establishes herself as one of the great Star Wars characters in the entire pantheon is Mara Jade.  She's a secretive, mysterious character in ""Heir"", her origin not being revealed until later in the saga, but she's hugely engaging, a powerfully driven ticking timebomb driven by hate and loss and biding her time as part of a smuggling outfit.  She's every bit as important a new character as Thrawn.Outstandingly written to the point where you can visualize the exotic locales with crystal clarity, can almost hear the thrum of the star destroyers and the mesmerising buzzing hum of the lightsabers, can practically Smell the lightsabers(like freshly fallen snow mixed with a hint of some flavor like vanilla or frosting or incense, I imagine them), ""Heir To The Empire"" places one right in the middle of the saga.  And proves masterfully that the story of ""Star Wars"" is fully justified in continuing on past the end of ""Return Of The Jedi"".  Magnificent.",5,"US"
2004-02-10,"Grand Adventure in a Galaxy Far, Far Away","For years, I kept myself away from the Star Wars novels in general, and particularly from those continuing the series. I thought that there could never be any author who could capture teh essence of the characters, the scope, and the conflict of the original after the events of Return of the Jedi. However, after some pleasent surprises in books like Shadows of the Empire, I decided to give Timothy Zahn's books a try. Sci-fi has never been the same for me since.Heir to the Empire marks a first in many ways. It was the first book that Lucas authorized to continue the Star Wars saga, and it is the first in what still reigns supreme as the best book trilogy the series has ever seen. Set five years after the death of Darth Vader and the Emperor, the newly formed New Republic finds itself threatened again by the Galactic Empire, this time, under new management. The new warlord that they face is a Grand Admiral from the days of old, Thrawn, a man unlike any in the Imperial Navy. Cunning, ruthless, and a strategical mastermind, Thrawn presents the greatest threat our heroes have seen since the Second Death Star.All the major players are here. Luke, now a full-fledged Jedi. Han and Leia, now married and expecting twins. Lando, Chewie, and the droids. All are in the story, and all are portrayed exactly as we remembered them, only better. And all play an integral part in thwarting the newest threat to the galaxy.However, Zahn does not just stop with high adventure and out favorite characters. Here, we meet new faces, including Thrawn, the insane Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth, and last but not least, Mara Jade. The best addition to the franchise since Lando Calrissian, Mara is a hardened rogue, used to life on the fringe, and desperate enemy of Luke. Of course, that means they'll have to work together sometime during the book. And what a team they make.All of Zahn's original characters feel right at home in the Star Wars universe, and they all have a part to play in the story. And what a story. Full of the space and saber combat expected in anything bearing the name, the tale takes readers from Coruscaunt to the Jedi power-negating world of Myrkr to the bridge of the Star Destroyer Chimera. The story twists and turns, and even as you see the conflict develop, you can see that this is only the beginning of something far more grand.I simply can't recommend this book enough. If there was an option for a sixth star, I'd happily give it to Zahn's masterpiece. It is no easy feat to recreate such a beloved universe and beloved characters, craft a satisfyingly epic story, keep the writing both exciting and intelligent, and still retain a ""PG"" rating. However, Zahn pulls it off with style to spare. This is space opera at its finest.",5,"US"
2003-07-05,"The Mind of Thrawn, the Hand of Zahn","Before this book, I had never read a Star Wars book. Nor had I ever read a book by Timothy Zahn. I was NOT ready for what I encountered. In the trilogy of books in this series, Zahn manages to create one of the coolest villains in all of sci-fi. Personally, I think Grand Admiral Thrawn is a better villain than Vader (but that just me). Through the course of the book he will take the remnants of the dying Empire and put them back on the road to supremacy. When I try to picture him in my mind I see him as a kind of evil version of General Lee in a sci-fi setting. He's a military genius with the uncanny ability to read the mind of his opponents and win repeatedly despite being vastly outnumbered. But is he really evil? Or just extremely ambitious?Also created in this amazing book series is what has become one fo the most popular characters in the Star Wars universe: Mara Jade. The red-haired young woman with strong force powers and a love/hate relationship with Luke Skywalker also makes a compelling new character. Of course with this being a Star Wars book, all the old characters from the movies return, and the feeling you get from listening to them might be compared to the feeling a person gets from meeting with some old friends he hasn't seen in a long time.Timothy Zahn's writing style isn't overly descriptive, but neither is it entirely cold. If I had to describe his style I would call it the perfect ADVENTURE style. When reading his books (and I have read several since this one), you get the same feeling you would from watching a book adventure film. Everything moves along at a brisk pace.Of course, the first book in the series is really just setting up the situation and the characters. We find out Thrawn intentions and see his grand plan start, but you'll have to read all three books to see the real meat of the story. I highly recommend all three books in the series.",4,"US"
1999-06-05,"Fabulous","People write things like ""Duh, it's a Galactic Republic, so how can Thrawn hurt them by attacking shipyards?""  Dense, maybe?  They're still technically rebels, they call it the New Republic so the galaxy will  be content, but they don't have as nearly much power as the Old Republic  and Empire (it's even called fragile on the back of the book, and is  continually called fragile on many other novels).  Also, the  ""pathetic"" Empire in this book is supposed to be small.  The  Battle of Endor annihilated most Imperial leaders.  Thrawn works with what  he has, thus ""remnants of the Imperial fleet,"" as stated on the  back cover, too.  Because this is not a movie, Thrawn has to set up a  complex story line that makes you want to read further.  Alas, many  illiterates will have trouble with it, because the movies are by nature  less cerebral than Zahn's novels (but not less exciting). They have to be  or people would think they're just boring films.  The space battles's  excitement depends on your imagination; if you rush through this book, it  will seem confusing, of course.  And no, there aren't fuzzy Ewoks or other  stupid creatures in this book, because Zahn is a serious sci-fi writer.  This is a dark trilogy, comparable to The Empire Strikes Back.  Therefore,  many won't enjoy it.  But don't give it 1 star if you don't understand it,  please.  And that's another point; this is a trilogy, so treat it like one  and read all the books, you'll be more satisfied. P.S. Many planets in the  SW galaxy have only one settlement on them, if you watch the films closely.  Whoever said Zahn's continuation of this fact was stupid is a poor-learned  person.",5,"US"
2013-11-19,"Great Book Made Even Better","Star Wars Heir To The Empire is a nice, classic Star Wars novel. I enjoyed the originality of it and the way it ended.The book is made even better by the new forward and annotations by the author. The new Thrawn novella is what sold it for me.Although it's great in hardcover format, I'd suggest buying it on Kindle if you have one, it's a lot cheaper in e-book format.All in all it's a fun classic Star Wars book that you can't put down and leaves you exited to see what happens in it's sequel.",5,"US"
1997-07-10,"What is Zahn trying to prove?","Timothy Zahn wanted very badly to prove that heknows Star Wars. He took it to such an extreme that the characters were ludicrously exaggerated,almost like charicatures. He spent so much of his book trying to show off his knowledge, the thought that he was supposed to be writing a good Star Wars novel must have slipped his mind. The characters were so off, I often found myself laughing so hard I couldn't continue reading. I finally finished the book, and when reflecting on the storyline and charaters, I felt so disappointed. Han and Leia are supposed to be in love. They never even see each other. It is made very clear that Leia doesn't care about her unborn children.Luke is supposed to be a Jedi. Jedis are serious, I suppose, but doesn't Luke get to do anything? All he did was sit and whine whenever asked to use his powers. Lando is supposed to be a nice guy. In this book, he acts as if he doesn't even like Luke, Leia, Han, and the rest. This book has a very tiring and predictible pattern: Someone plans an attack. The intended narrowly escapes and flees. Grand Admiral Thrawn somehow figures out exactly what they've done. Grand Admiral Thrawn sends out Noghri to attack again, and the wearying, neverending process begins again. Not to mention, even if Thrawn is quite clever-I find it extremely hard to believe that he can figure out the actions of anyone in an entire culture by briefly studying a few people's art. This book frustrated me to a point where I wanted to hurl it to the floor and rip it to shreds. Maybe the rest of the trilogy won't be quite as bad.",2,"US"
2003-09-19,"Excellent","I just re-read this book for the first time in many years, and it still struck me how well this book is written.  Timothy Zahn does an absolutely first-rate job in taking old characters I grew up with and developing even them even more.  The dialogue, interaction and narrative all perfectly reflect the tone of the original films.  It is great to read the back and forth between Han and Leia, Lando, Luke and all of the old favorites.  Not only that, new characters are so well developed and well realized that they become instantly iconic and blend seamlessly into the Star Wars tapestry.  First and foremost is Grand Admiral Thrawn, much more than a cookie-cutter villain, whose intuition and cunning make him interesting as well as ruthless.  Talon Karrde is an instantly likable character and Mara Jade is a great antagonist.  Her interactions with Karrde and Luke Skywalker give her some much needed dimension.  Joruus C'Baoth and Garm Bel Iblis also are incredibly well written, as are smaller players like Captain Pellaeon, Khabarakh and the Noghri, and even Borsk Fey'lya, who is written as a perfectly manipulative politician.Reading this book for a second time let me see the numerous subtle hints woven into all three books in this trilogy.  The subtlety Zahn uses is excellent, the twists and revelations, while not shocking, are thought out with care and detail.  I like the fact that there is no Imperial superweapon being used, and instead it deals mostly with tactics, skill and intelligence.  The ultimate plot leaves you satisified, which says a lot more than most of the Star Wars books I have read lately.After the bad taste that the last few New Jedi Order books gave me, it was very reassuring to go back and enjoy this book and the other two books in this trilogy.  They are truly worthy to be made into films (if only they could be), and are immensely satisfying books.",5,"US"
2002-05-23,"Great Story, Mediocre Writing","In this book and the two other books of Tim Zahn's trilogy, he fully displays his writing weaknesses and strengths. He is a skilled storyteller, and his continuation of the ""Star Wars"" story following ""Return of the Jedi"" is masterfully packed with suspense, action, exotic landscapes, and epic battles. Zahn is also adept at characterization. Many of our old favorites are here, but it's the new characters who truly shine, particularly Grand Admiral Thrawn. His patience, coolness, and staggering intellect make him the most frightening Imperial leader ever. Unfortunately, these books desperately needed to be glanced over by a good editor before they were published. Zahn has annoying writing habits that will get on your nerves if you are a critical reader. For example, he constantly and randomly switches the way he refers to characters. One minute we're reading about ""Luke,"" our old Jedi pal, and the next minute we're reading about ""Skywalker,"" which is a cold and impersonal way to refer to a character many readers grew up with. That may not seem like much, but Zahn does it so often, you begin to wonder if there's a reason. There isn't, other than bad editing. Zahn also latches on to tin-eared phrases and unusual constructions and uses them repeatedly, so that they stick out and make you wonder why he doesn't try a new way to say the same thing. If you're not critical, you'll love the stories in these books. But if you're like me, your enjoyment of the wonderful plots will be dampened by the clunky, unpolished writing. I'll say this...these books would surely make incredible movies. Maybe when George Lucas kicks the bucket....",3,"US"
2006-10-30,"the thrawn trilogy by timothy zhan","The Thrawn trilogy by timothy ZhanThe Thrawn trilogy by timothy Zhan is a continuation of the original star warsTrilogy that follows directly after the movie return of the jedi. In these books Luke skywalker, the main character is the one who defeated the emperor along with darth Vader his father. Luke in the books is the one that has to destroy the dark Jedi joruus ceobth. He was trying to corrupt the jedi princess leia's Jedi twins and Luke and leia. In these books the grand admiral that took control of the crushed imperial fleet and prepared for combat my favorite part is when the two katana dreadnoughts fought the more heavily armed imperial star destroyers. In this part the imperials and the republic are fighting over the katana ships but most of the katana ships already have bean taken by the imperials. When Luke and the others find out the clones are manning the ships they plan a mission to destroy the cloning cylinders. I would recommend this book to anybody that likes the star wars movies or the books. I thought these were very interesting because the admiral isn't even human or a Jedi. And he was very smart because he had the thought of finding the slave circuit katana fleet that went out of control and disappeared causing the crews to go insane and kill each other. That took place during the clone wars. This book is full of battles and violence because its star wars.",5,"US"
2016-05-30,"The fabulous sequel trilogy to Return of the Jedi","Heir to the Empire and the larger Thrawn trilogy..What can I say about this phenomenally well researched, written and developed novel and series. other than it and they are just that and more.Heir to the empire takes readers back to the magic and roots of the original trilogy and the characters  we know and love therein and speeds the reader into new adventures with our established heroes and villains whilst introducing legendary new ones, Gilad Pellaeon, Mara Jade, Talon Karride and Thrawn etc, who would forever define the Star Wars lore.From the beginning chapters on Coruscant, the adventures and trials on  Kashyyyk, Bimmisaari and myrkr and  wayland to the thrilling final act ..The opening battle of Thrawn's campaign and the possibly defeat of the New Republic?Heir to the Empire is  a non-stop roller-coaster of surprises, action, character development and thrills. And the larger  Thrawn trilogy is essential reading for any reader and certainly any Star Wars fan.",5,"US"
2001-03-11,"One of the best Star Wars novels I have ever read","I read this book for the first time a few months ago, and while  I liked it a lot, most of the technical details went completely over my head.  Now that I've read it again however, I understand it much better overall.  This trilogy, being the first authorized  continuation to the saga, is to say the least, the cornerstone of all Star Wars fiction.  Every Star Wars fan should read it at least once, preferably before everything else, even the things that are set before it.  Anyway, the story is set five years after Return of the Jedi, at a time when the New Republic has beaten back most of the broken shards of the Empire, but there is  still plenty of occasional turmoil.  By this time, Han and Leia are married and have twins on the way, and Luke is finally a true  Jedi Knight.  However, peace is not to be, because suddenly a new and incredibly intelligent grand admiral appears, and begins harrasing the New Republic.  The Imperials also win the help of Joruus C'Baoth, a dark Jedi, by promising to deliver Luke, Leia, and her unborn twins to him so he can turn them all to the dark side.  The Empire also gets some help from a band of smugglers run by Talon Karrde and Mara Jade, a force sensitive with a mysterious past.  C'Baoth calls Luke to him through the force, and Luke, not knowing what else to do, goes to him, but is intercepted and captured by Mara Jade, who has an intense dislike  for Luke, to put it mildly.  Anyway, this is one of the best Star Wars books around and I would recommend it to anyone, even someone who isn't a die-hard fan.  The author has a close-to-home, yet highly elequent writing style, and he portrays  the characters as if he knew them personally.  Speaking of characters, Pellaeon shows that not even all imperials are evil, and Mara Jade is arguably the coolest, most awesome Star Wars character who wasn't in the movies.  She and Luke are great together, even when they don't want to be, and let's just say I have a strong feeling about those two...  Also, Chewie actually had a personality in this book, and isn't treated like some overgrown pet who has no feelings like he is in some other Star Wars books, but like a friend and family member, like he's supposed to be.  Also, while this is an adult book, anyone could read it as long as they have a good enough vocabulary to handle the writing style.",5,"US"
1999-04-15,"Awsome","About the Star wars Trilogy  Books by: Timothy Zahn This series takes place five years after the death of the Emperor or the Return of the Jedi (the movie).  The first book in the series is the Heir to the Empire.  It starts out on a star ship that the Grand Admiral, Thrawn was staying on.  He proves his skills by defeating a small legion of enemy X wing fighters.  But its not just him defeating them its how he does it.  He destroys the  them by sing a old trick that should be easy for anyone to get out of but  unfortunately they tried too hard and basically destroyed them selves.  In  this book it tells you that Princess Leah and Han Solo got married and  princess Leah is expecting twins.  The grand admiral seeks out a Man named  C'boath because he needs a Jedi to help in his master plan to take over the  Rebellion and take over the entire universe.  C'boath wants Luke Skywalker  because he is a very powerful Jedi Knight and he also wants Princess Leah  because she is expecting Jedi twins and there is suppose to be some very  amazing powers that Jedi twins have.  C'boath gets what he wants by the end  of the book and The Princess and Luke both end up on a mining colony.  The second book DarkForce Rising is mostly about how They get of the  colony, and how Grand Admiral Thrawn gets the things that he needs for his  master plan of having millions of dark minion clones at his every control.  In the last book of the series The Last Command princess Leah has her twin  babies, Grand Admiral Thrawn makes his cloning machine but as you can  already guess Luke Han and the Princess stop his evil plan.",5,"US"
2007-03-25,"The New Republic meets a New Force","Heir to the Empire is a Star Wars novel where we see an Empire that has experienced 5 years of defeat from the New Republic fighting back.  The Empires new ability to fight back is due to a new Grand Admiral (Thrawn) and his intuition for cultures and his having not being in the .  To overcome the New Republic, Grand Admiral Thrawn raids the Emperor's store house, finds a Jedi to support him, and sets commando teams on the trail of Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker.Heir to the Empire does a very good job of capturing the feel of the Star Wars Universe.  Mr. Zahn does an excellent job of capturing Luke, Princess Leia, and Han Solo.  The dialog and the development of the story fits very well into what we know as Star Wars.  My chief complaints are that at points it moves a little slowly and Grand Admiral Thrawn was a little to perfect.  If Grand Admiral Thrawn was as perfect as Mr. Zahn describes him, why was he unknown to the New Republic and fighting on the edge of the Empire.  Despite these detractions, I found Heir to the Empire to be enjoyable and look forward to reading the rest in this series.  Given everything, this is a strong 4 star book, but not worthy of 5 stars.",4,"US"
2008-05-17,"Almost the first Expanded Universe Novel!","That is if you don't count Splinter of the Mind's Eye, or the Han trilogy, or Lando trilogy.  This is a great series and could easily be credited with keeping the Star Wars series in the general populace's eye during the late eighties and early nineties.  With no new films to date Star Wars was officially over in 1983 with Return of the Jedi, that is of course until this was published.One thing that stands out as exceptionally well done is the sense of military tactics and space battles, which ironically was missing from even the Prequel Movies.  Zahn's pacing is quick but precise and leaves readers with a good sense of tension that keeps them reading to see how it gets resolved.  The natural progression of the characters from the end of the last film (Episode 6) is apparent and the dialog is well written.  He really captured the feel of each of the characters and the sense of scope with his descriptions.  The opening scene with Luke and Obi-Wan is touching and written with a good sense of the relationship between the characters.  Having read this series twice I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it!Whether you care for Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy or not, you can't deny that it is the series by which all other Expanded Universe material is judged.",5,"US"
2007-04-29,"Best of the Expanded Universe","In my opinion Timothy Zahn is the best of the writers continueing the adventures of the original Star Wars heroes in the time following the movie Return of the Jedi.In this first book of the Thrawn Trilogy, Heir to the Empire introduces us to a calculating, diabolic Grand Admiral by the name of Thrawn who just might hold the tactical military power to mount a resurgence of Empirial dominion.As Zahn was formerly a military and action fiction writer, and he is able to handle this master mind character with extreem perfection.The author is also excellent in understanding the original Star Wars characters, and though these heros continue to develope through the course of the trilogy they retain the distinct personality that made us love them on the big screen. Plus his excellent descriptions are reminiscent of the intriguing detail used by more mainstream authors like Stephen King and Tom Clancy.These stories would make great movies, just like the blockbusters that inspired them, and no doubt like other reviewers have said you will be able to hear the music, see the special effects, and smell the popcorn as you read in quiet contentment!J.

1999-05-18,"It is THE Star Wars book on the market.","There are now hundreds of Star Wars books on the market now, but this is the one that started it all.  This is the one that contains the most drama, action, suspense, and imagination that is unmatched by any of the others  released by Anderson and Stackpole.  Zahn researched his topic beautifully,  and wrote like an artist.  His book is worthy of the subject he wrote:  the  unbeatable space saga known as Star Wars.  His book contains no flaws, his  characters are true to George Lucas's amazing vision. There is a new  threat to emerge and attack the New Republic.  In the first installment,  you meet the greatest military mind alive, the Grand Admiral Thrawn.  Thrawn is the only alien Grand Admiral in the fleet, and has the uncanny  ability to predict opponent actions beforehand.  As Luke searches for Jedi  relics from the Past, and Leia tries to  hold together the fragile New  Republic, Thrawn finds himself a weapon that could spell doom to the  Rebels:  an insane Dark Jedi Master.  And there is only one thing that this  Jedi wants, and Thrawn has promised to provide:  Han and Leia's two unborn  Jedi twins to raise as his own. Timothy Zahn writes this saga with  unmatched skill, and you can just feel yourself being transportred to that  galaxy far far away...",5,"US"
2003-10-08,"If only Episode 1 & 2 were as good as THIS Trilogy...","My hat is off to Timothy Zahn, in my opinion, the BEST Star Wars novelist writing today.  It seemed that until the early 90's, the only major series of books to read in the sci-fi universe had Star Trek on the cover -- that is until George Lucas gave the OKAY for Timothy Zahn to begin what would become arguably the best series of Star Wars books written...PERIOD.I noticed one reviewer hailed 'Heir To The Empire' as Episode VII and I believe that was just about the best title, because Zahn so perfectly captured the *feel* of the Star Wars Universe that it in every way exceeded the three original movies.  I can't tell you how great it was to get re-acquianted with Han & Leia as a married (and expecting) couple, Lando, Luke as well as a whole group of new characters which hold their own against any previous in the series.  Grand Admiral Thrawn is simply a better bad guy than both Darth Vader & the Emperor combined.  He uses good old fashioned brains and military tactics to win for the Empire and although he sees a minor defeat at the end of 'Heir' this in no way slows down his ultimate plan on crushing the Alliance.  As you wind yourself through this book and the following 2 books in this series, you see how Zahn sprinkled so much in between the lines of how his version of a tale told in a galaxy far, far away should be.  You have absolutely everything that made the original 3 movies so good, the Force, the Dark Side, and epic battle scenes.  We get inside the head of Luke Skywalker (a very interesting place to be, I might add), you get an extra dose of humor from Han, and let's not forget the wit & wisdom of C3PO.  It's ALL here.  I particularly enjoyed the introduction of Talon Karrde, Mara Jade and the very unique creatures that have the ability to repel the Force.  I found it absolutely brilliant how Zahn incorporated that into the overall story, particularly in 'The Last Command' and their critical help in creating a menacing clone army for the New & Improved Empire.There simply is not a SINGLE negative thing I can think of about these books.  Maybe I'm building them up too big for you, but I don't think so.  Any Star Wars fan worth his/her salt ought to make reading these 3 novels required.  Unfortunately there are a glut of SW novels on the market today, MOST of which are a gigantic waste of trees in my opinion.  The New Jedi Order novels which pretty much began with the promising 'Vector Prime' have deteriorated into a farce that just happens to be using the Star Wars name to advance utter drivel.  But if you can find anything with Timothy Zahn's name on the front, you are guaranteed a story that will entertain as well as inform you about the world of Star Wars.  Just HOW good is Zahn?  Believe it or not, the planet Coruscant was such a good creation, George Lucas BORROWED it for use in the Phantom Menace.  Yes, it's true, Lucas did NOT come up with that one by himself.  I have talked with one of the authors of a single Star Wars novel and they told me that in their conversations with Mr. Lucas, he admitted that Zahn's Trilogy was the equal to anything he had managed to come up with, and possibly better.  You cannot find a better endorsement than that, now can you?  Go ahead, give in and buy 'Heir To The Empire' if you haven't yet.  You will be amazed how good it is -- especially if you have managed to suffer through any of the trash that has come out in the past 5 or 6 years with the Star Wars name on the cover.  Once you give in to this, you will most certainly follow by reading the two sequels, 'Dark Force Rising' (which isn't what you may think it is) and 'The Last Command'.  Truly worthy of the Star Wars name.  Timothy Zahn IS the master.",5,"US"
1998-10-27,"Decent follow up to the classic movies.","Frankly, Mr. Zahn did not have an enviable task ahead of him when he was to write the followup trilogy to Star Wars.  I opened this book tentatively, fearing the worst.  After all, with Luke as the New Jedi, Leia  and Han itemized together, Chewbacca still as hairy as ever, and the  Emperor and Darth dusty particles in space, what could any writer possibly  do to continue the line?Happily, though, I found Heir to the Empire  nowhere near the disaster that normal logic would foretell.  The characters  of old SW films were believably drawn, although curiously timeless (I mean,  come on...it's five years after Endor, and the only change is that Leia's  pregnancy!), and Zahn's new people were either suitably grey in the  background, or very colorfully developed indeed.The plot seems very much  Lucasian fare; shootouts, rescue missions, daring raids, and harrowing  escapes.  However, I became increasingly aware of an inexplicable flaw in  the otherwise strong storytelling; that concerned the big baddie, Grand  Admiral Thrawn.Thrawn is touted as a genius who can divine enemies'  innermost psyches with nothing but examples of their artwork.  That's okay;  Zahn makes this seem convincing enough so that our disbelief is suspended.  Thrawn is presented as an enigmatic leader who is feared but more  importantly respected by his people.  This too is okay; Zahn shows enough  strategy and tactics to convince us that his character really deserves  this.  Many seemingly-impossible victories are pulled out of thin air, and  Thrawn continues to win and win and win a little more.Fine.  We can  accept that...how could we otherwise, with such skill expended in making  him believable?  By the time the book is over, Zahn even implies Thrawn's  superiority over great villains like Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine  (wonderful name, don't you agree?) - and we can readily believe this,  because Zahn has given us the goods and not been found wanting.So, the  big question and flaw of the story: why does Thrawn lose?  Zahn falls prey  to the same trap that ensnares many writers of all genres; he has presented  a full-bodied, fleshed-out character, made the reader love to hate him,  shown this man to be utterly brilliant and utterly amazing and  God-like...then kills him off.No replay, no reset.  Game over.  Dead.The 'God' syndrome, I think it's called, where the enemy is really  powerful, but for an unsatisfactory reason is defeated.  Without a doubt,  Zahn is one of the best space-fantasy writers I have read, and his style is  engrossing and engaging, but I could not help but feel that at the end of  the tale, I was somehow cheated by the unconvincing and accelerated death  of his Thrawn character.The only reason I can think of for writing such  an unappetising ending to an otherwise excellent trilogy, is that Zahn was  pressured into it for reasons of PR.  Certainly, the way is paved for a  ""Return of Thrawn"" episode, as Thrawn dropped many hints of  cloning facilities, etc. (qv Specter of the Past and Vision of the Future)  but I thought it would have been better to just keep the guy and conclude  the trilogy otherwise.Also slightly problematic is the question of  repetition: Thrawn is a purely tactical guy, so he needs a force-user to  help him.  Working together, Thrawn and the crazed Jedi Master named Joruus  can just about equal Vader's total effectiveness (tactics + force).  One  cannot help but feel that Zahn is fighting a losing battle here regarding  his villains; Lucas just made his ones too darn good.Apart from those  two (not immediately obvious) points, the books are all a great ride  through Lucas' galaxy once again.  If you liked the movies at all and don't  mind reading good sci-fi, then these are the books for you.  Certainly they  are better than any later Star Wars efforts I have read (ah - K J Anderson  - hem!).",4,"US"

When the book was originally published in 1991, I remember telling a friend it would start a literary genre similar to Star Trek with hundreds of books.  Even though I find an overwhelming number of books diluting to a storyline, Zahn's work resurrected with a passion a universe in written format for other authors to continue exploring.Timothy Zahn introduces a destroyed Empire and fragile New Republic, strange creatures, and compelling heroes and villains.  The originality and creativity in the series is deep, far better than the sorry episode 1 and 2 movies.Grand Admiral Thrawn is an ingenious, calculating and efficient villain, someone the New Republic should fear.  The typical assortment of characters ranging from Luke Skywalker to Wedge Antilles fills the book with essential components to the tale.  While Star Wars hasn't been overly political, politics play a part in the developments and brings more depth to an otherwise action oriented plot.I highly recommend this series above all others to any fan of the Star Wars universe.Thank you.",5,"US"
2006-08-14,"Heir to the Empire a story to behold.","Star Wars Heir to the empire is the first of the three stories Timothy Zahn has wrote and is one to behold. A story with drama, dramatic irony, climatic scenes, and so much more. The story takes place after the events of Return of the Jedi. Han and Leia are married and Leia is pregnant with twins, the Empire while weakened is still under the rule of the most cunning of the few remaining warlords known as Grand Admiral Thrawn with a plot to take down the New Republic,and Luke Skywalker still struggling with his newly pronouced state as a Jedi Master goes seeking out an old currupted Jedi Master named Master C'boath. While these events play out though, a smuggler named Karrde and his partner Mara Jade go out to find information about Thrawn's plans with Karrde's buisness. While the fact Mara wants to kill Luke Skywalker for some reason.As the story and events play out the story seems to go out like one of the original trilogy movies. The events just play out like a movie and I still can remember hearing the musical orchestra playing in the background. It is a marvel to behold and just saying but this book was the first that got me into the Star Wars novels.",5,"US"
2003-10-16,"The Beginning of the Greatest SW Trilogy Ever!","I first read Heir to the Empire when it was released.  Since that book I have been enchanted with a universe long ago and far away.  Really it was the Zahn books more than the orignal movie trilogy that made me into a Star Wars fan.  I have read and reviewed every book in the expanded universe from the exellent Zahn, Stackpole, Keyes & Denning to the horrible Anderson, Kube-McDowell, Hambly & McIntyre.  Heir to the Empire is the book that began all that troublesome mixture of continuity that is called the expanded universe.  Zahn is first and foremost and excellent writer.  He has a firm grasp of his characters, and uses the movies as a springboard rather than a crutch.  In Heir to the Empire Zahn introduces 4 of the best characters in the Star Wars universe: Talon Karrde, smuggler chief extraordinaire a smuggler, who unlike Han Solo is in it for the money and understands the importance of information, Mara Jade sometime Jedi and personal assassin to the Emperor with a mad on for Luke Skywalker, Borsk Fey'la a crafty and ruthless Bothan politician whose treads just on the right side of good in his quest for personal power and the most deadly superweapon ever produced by the Empire: Grand Admiral Thrawn a man as deadly as he competant.  A soldier whose ulitmate goal is not destruction but the reunification of the Empire.  Karrde, Jade and Fey'la continue to be featured right through the current New Jedi Order series, a testament to their popularity and origins.  While Thrawn has never returned after the events of this Trilogy, his ghost remains floating in the background of many of the recent Star Wars novels. Our old friends have also changed a bit Han Solo still a risk taker but married to a now pregnant Princess Leia burdoned by politics but well on her way to becoming a Jedi and Luke Skywalker, not the brooding, depressed hero of later novels, but full of life yet NOT invincible.  All in all Heir to the Empire is an excellent beginning to one of the greatest sci-fi literary achievements, as its run as a New York Times Bestseller is a testament of.",5,"US"
2003-11-25,"The best SW novel in the Best Star Wars book trilogy","I picked up Heir to the Empire when it was new almost 8 years ago. Timothy Zahn has written a Star Wars masterpiece that had me hooked from day one when I picked it up.Heir to the Empire picks up five years after the Battle of Endor. Princess Leia has married Han Solo. They have two children. Luke is the only jedi that is known to be. The empire is still strong though and is led by Grand Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn has a devious plan set in place to destroy the New Republic. It envolves a Dark Jedi that is capable of taking out Luke. His plan is aimed directly at the New Republic and could destroy them all.Like I said earlier Zahn has written a masterpiece. He plays the Star Wars universe so well. Up to the point when he wrote the book all he had to base off was the movies and a couple of novels. His new insights into the world are great. His book is just like an extension of the original three movies. He carries the arogance of Han Solo into the book. You still see the childlike innocence of Luke and you see his troubles as he tires to establish himself.Zahn's work with Grand Admiral Thrawn is amazing. He's one of the top villians I've ever read about. Zahn gives you a great mental picture of what the man looks like. With the details you get consumed by him and for a time while I was reading I wanted  the Empire to win because this guy was so cool and smart.The new side characters that Zahn has made are great. I love Karrade and Mara Jade. They were both great characters. I loved the new alien species he thought up. Nothing was to far fetched and everything was described so well you got a good mental picture of everything.This is an excellent novel. You can argue it as the best Star Wars novel ever written and it's easily in the best Star Wars book trilogy. Timothy Zahn has written an absolutely fantastic sci-fi trilogy. Fans of the movie might not appreciate it to much, but if you love the movies and what a continuation pick up this book. You won't regret it.",5,"US"
2002-11-02,"A Star Wars Classic","Timothy Zahn writes a tight and compelling plot peopled with strong characters, and his book radiates with the feeling of the Star Wars movies without rehashing them (a trap into which too many franchise books fall).  This is a worthy continuation of the story of Luke, Han, Leia, et. al.  If you read any Star Wars novels, start here--especially because so many of the later books, when they aren't pirating lines from the movies (as though the only sentences that exist in our galaxy far, far away are ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" ""Do or do not, there is no try,"" and ""Never quote me the odds"") are pirating and misusing plot ideas from Zahn's brilliant trilogy.  Also, by starting with Heir to the Empire, you'll properly introduce yourself to a new cast of favorite characters--Mara Jade, Talon Kaarde, etc--who Zahn so strongly characterizes that even the worst Star Wars authors can write them.  And most importantly, you won't risk growing tired of the old steadies like Luke.  Characters like him sometimes stagnate in other Star Wars books (particularly in the utterly foul Jedi Academy Trilogy, only worth reading because you meet Kyp Durron who, though horribly botched in these books, becomes rather important later on) when their authors can't impart to them the sort of dynamism and personality evident in the movies.  But in Heir to the Empire, Luke is not a cardboard recreation of his cinematic self; rather, he is full and human.  With brilliant writing and brilliant protagonists and antagonists  (I mean literally, there are some smart, quick thinking characters in this book who really make for an awesome plot), this book is a Star Wars classic.",5,"US"
2000-07-22,"A Wonderful Star Wars Continuation","This book is the first novel in Timothy Zahn's trilogy.  This excellently written book takes place five years after Return of the Jedi, and is the authorized continuation to the original trilogy.In this first book in  the series, we are introduced to Grand Admiral Thrawn, the sole surviving  member of the Emperor's vicious staff.  He has resumed control over the  Imperial Starfleet as he prepares for a suprise attack on the New Republic.  Thrawn is a supreme villian.  He exemplifies patience, tenacity, and  extreme poise in all of the story's crucial situations.In his campaign  for domination, he employs the powers of a long-lost dark Jedi Knight,  which later leads to several conflicts.  All of the original characters are  back in Heir to the Empire, as well as some interesting new ones.Zahn  writes with incredible detail that makes for a descriptive plot.  He  develops the storyline and teases you just enough to make you want to read  the next book in the trilogy.This book is action-packed and Zahn mixes  the characters together nicely.  He cohesively loads the book with mystery  and suspense, and the character development is fabulous.The underlying  conflict of good vs. evil is interesting because it is hard to tell who is  good and who is evil.  All in all, this was a nice, easy-flowing book and  an entertaining read.  You will enjoy it.",4,"US"

It reads like a brand new Star Wars movie - just what I was hoping for! The wording, descriptions of characters, scenes, events, and progression of the storyline really draws you into the novel. It's pretty thick, so I have a feeling it'll hold me over until Ep 7 comes out. You just wanna keep reading, but you know you have to put it down and go to bed at some point, right?!

2013-06-18,"A story that stays with you","I read this book when it was first released in 1992 or so. Reflecting on it today, over 20 years later, I am pleased with how the story has aged--as if it is canon, part of the original movie trilogy. The characters, such as Mara Jade, Grand Admiral Thrawn, the Ysalamiri creatures, the apolitical Dark Jedi, and their stories just really seemed lifelike to me. Now, reading it again, I find it every bit as enjoyable as the first time, two decades hence. I have a suspicion that this story arc, including the two sequel books, may very well be involved in the new Star Wars 7 film, directed by J.J. Abrams. What other story could he base the new movie on while including members of the original cast, but a post-ROTJ storyline? And what story is better than the Thrawn trilogy? :)",5,"US"
2001-11-09,"I didn't want to like it...","A long time ago, in a book store far away, someone suggested Timothy Zahn to me. I skimmed the first few pages, and in my impatient youth, shoved the book back onto the shelf with a muttered ""Nah...""But that's not a BAD thing. That's a GOOD thing. Because I read it last week, and was totally blown away.Characters... the portrayal of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and all the others we know so well was solid. Mara Jade is just tremendously entertaining, and Captain Pellaeon is a terrific window into the Imperial Activities.Grand Admiral Thrawn... ""Whoa"". A tactical genius with an awesome talent for determining a species' military blind spots from their artwork, Thrawn is controlled, precise, coldly calculating and even entertaining. There were points where I was cheering for him, only to be turned right around when he went after my favorite folks in the New Republic.Great bad-guys are a rare and valuable thing. Thrawn qualifies completely.The story is compelling, and there is no deux es machina (god in a box) ending in this. It goes on until the tale is told. A great novel, and I am pleased to have finally read it. And four other Star Wars novels by the same author.:)Warning: It ends on a cliff-hanger. Great book, and the sequel... well, read the reviews. Read MY review. But whichever, read the books.If you liked Wedge's Gamble, Isard's Revenge, or Solo Command, you'll dig this.",5,"US"
2005-12-11,"A Great Intro to a Great Series","This series is a lot of fun, unlike many other books which were created from either television shows or movies. I was a bit skeptical when I first heard about, having skimmed The Hand of Thrawn Trilogy by the same author, I was quite sure what to expect... pleasantly surprised!This series part of the Star Wars Expanded Universe - a universe put together chiefly by authors whom have written about characters or stories dealing with characters related to the Star Wars universe set forth by George Lucas. Much of the Expanded Universe is set forth in comic book form, while a small majority has made it as actual novels. George Lucas is not responsible for the independent growth of the Expanded Universe. Writers like Timothy Zahn are writers whose works have surpassed George Lucas's films by leaps and bounds.Heir to the Empire tells the story of Grand Admiral Thrawn, a Chiss (an overly intelligent humanoid race whose eyes are read and whose skin is blue), and his quest to resurrect the fallen Empire after the Imperial defeat mentioned in the three original Star Wars movies. Thrawn isn't you average human character with ideologies which match human ideologies... he plays the part well of a cold and calculating Chiss whose only goal is to bring order and strength to the universe, order in the form of the Empire.This novel is truly interesting because even if you weren't all that interested in a sci-fi read before, Zahn has the amazing military know how to make this novel appealing to anyone who likes reading about technical things (even if they are made up for the most part), or intense military battles (Zahn is a master at this, unparalleled in sci-fi/fantasy writings for it). The novel is a quick read, with fun characters if not a bit flat (as one would expect from many books which were somehow based off of movies), and fun around every corner for both younger and older audiences alike!But it wouldn't be completely fair to Mr. Zahn to name only the good things about the book and inevitably the series as a whole.As mentioned at times the characters seem a bit flat. For instance, while it is a great idea it comes across as a little bogus that Grand Admiral Thrawn could determine personality types and therefore individuals' courses of action on the battlefield. Is that really a big deal? Not really, what is though happens to be that the Grand Admiral Thrawn has little to no personality of his own - his subordinates have even less, as Zahn seemingly tries to have Thrawn's second in command - a man by the name of Palleon - have feelings about his former boss and compare those feelings to how he feels about the Grand Admiral. In the end this completely fails since no character is given a paragraph worth of description or explanation as to why they think the way they do.Admittedly Grand Admiral Thrawn's intelligence is not obvious to the reader - that is to say any supremely logical connections he makes cannot be figured out by the reader, not because he's so intelligent, but because there's nothing to really figure out... Zahn makes it up as he goes along.You end up liking the characters in this trilogy for who they seem to be through their actions and dialogue (which there is plenty of), the short amount of highly technical description you are given (which is presented in a ""high quality"" way), and any information you can bring with you from the Expanded Universe (if you don't have any, there is a good chance you might have missed a lot when reading the novels). If you don't know that much about Star Wars and/or the Expanded Universe, or don't care for it, you might not enjoy this series at all.Despite some flaws which could have easily been corrected (but I suppose not at the expense of keeping a relatively medium sized book), Heir to the Empire and the trilogy it starts is just damn great for fans of Star Wars and fans of the Expanded Universe. Truly adds more depth to the rich world of Star Wars! Something remarkable not seen since the original three movies, and in the end it might just surpass them in many respects!",5,"US"
2006-06-28,"Stars wars fans should pick this up!","The Thrawn Trilogy, Volume 1, Heir to the EmpireThis series starts five years after ""The Return of the Jedi"". The last of the grand admirals, Grad Admiral Thrawn has taken control of the last of the Imperial Fleet and is putting together a plan to finish off the rebel alliance. Princess Leia and Han have been married and Leia is expecting twins and Luke attempts to continue his Jedi training with what little information has been able to uncover.The Good: This book (and the entire series) was very good. The writer did a good job of capturing the characters and it was good to read more of them including Luke, Han, Leia, Lando, Wedge and more. The story was plotted out very well, the attack plans from Thrawn were well thought out. There is plenty of action and battles etc. and the introduction of a new Dark Jedi.The Bad: The only thing that comes to mind was that Grand Admiral Thrawn was a little too perceptive at points. But other than that nothing comes to mind.Overall the book was very good and definitely worth picking up if you are a Star Wars fan.",4,"US"
2000-03-27,"By FAR the best book ever written for a galaxy far away","This is the best Star Wars book ever written, hands down. A strong introduction, intermediary, and conclusion help make this book the greatest. Its villain, Grand Admiral Thrawn, is one of the greatest  villains ever created. He is frightening, cold blooded, and has terrific  eccentricities that make him more believable. What is most unusual, and  impressive about him is that he is INTELLIGENT. This is something that is  far too often overlooked when you read other novels. You actually grow to  respect him as the book goes on. You really have to read the books in order  to understand this respect, you respect him as a person, as an adversary,  and as an equal. His strategies are believable, well thought out, and  understandable. Some fellow readers even would go so far as to say that  they found themselves rooting for the Grand Admiral. The characters from  the movies are all there, believable as ever. Luke, Han, Chewie, Lando, the  droids, and Leia are all well portrayed, as well as several other  characters who you might have noticed in the backgrounds. None of the  intertwining plot lines ever even borders on confusing, and you are always  on the edge of your seat. When I first read this book, it was the first  Star Wars book I ever read. I went up to read the first few chapters, and  ""woke up"" hours later, having finished the book's entirety. You  can read any one of the trilogy as a single novel, or as part of the  greater picture. It is never difficult to catch on to the characters, or  their trials as they battle for control of a galaxy far, far away.",5,"US"
2012-02-21,"Very well written, but maybe too much buildup","Heir to the Empire is the book that kickstarted the Expanded Universe.  There were others before it, but Star Wars was all but dead when this book was released.Pros:-The novel is very well written.  It captured the Star Wars ""environment"" almost perfectly and it did feel like a true extension of the series.-The characters are wonderfully written.  The author made sure that they were still the characters we know and love but also had them develop naturally as the story went on.  The three new ""main"" characters, Mara Jade, Thrawn, and Jorrus, are interesting and leave me wanting to see a lot more of them.Cons:-The plot.  I gave this 4 out of 5 stars so I didn't think the plot was awful, but it was definitely the weakest part of an otherwise extremely strong novel.  The plot focused too much on background and buildup and towards the end you realize that you are not much further than you were when you started.  Thrawn is smart, but at times I felt his intelligence was a copout to move the story forward.  There was no way he knew enough information to make some of the extremely accurate predictions he made.Overall I am extremely excited to read Dark Force Rising as I am interested to see where the story goes now that the buildup is complete.",4,"US"
2007-03-21,"An excellent villain","Grand Admiral Thrawn. Those words should strike fear into any Star Wars fan. Unfortunately George Lucas scrapped the idea of ""Episodes 7, 8, and 9,"" and so we are left with our own imaginations to fill in the missing parts of his story. To say that this man is evil, cunning, and in every way a perfect villain is simply an understatement. Much like Darth Vader (the REAL Darth Vader, not the joke impostor foisted upon us in the last 3 S.W. movies), and Peter Cushing's character in Episode 4 (er... the first Star Wars movie), and Darth Maul: we - need - more. More villainy. More Thrawn. This book is not so much a story about everyone else involved in the plot as it is an introduction to a man so devious - and - brilliant that he overshadows the very plot itself.If you wish to know more about what happens in the book, please do read other reviews, as they will undoubtedly reveal various plot points and twists. I simply wish to enlighten you to the fact that one of Star Wars' greatest characters was born in this book and lament that it really was a shame that he did not get a starring role in a movie so that the world could witness just how dangerous men like him are. If you saw ANY of the Star Wars movies, read-this-book. It is that good, and that important to th Star Wars saga. All the rest is commentary.",4,"US"
2005-08-29,"one of the best Star Wars novels, introduces Thrawn and Mara Jade","In a very real sense ""Heir to the Empire"" is the reason there are so many Star Wars novels being published these days.  While in the 1980's there were several Star Wars Expanded  Universe novels published, it was not until ""Heir to the Empire"" that the Star Wars boom really took place for novels.  ""Heir to the Empire"" is set five years after the events of ""The Return of the Jedi"" and the New Republic is growing, is gaining strength and popularity.  The fight is not over, though.  Grand Admiral Thrawn is still holding on to the legacy of the Empire and he continues to fight against the New Republic.  What is more, he is actually starting to win battles.Thrawn takes the fight right to the heart of the New Republic, to Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo.  To the unborn children of Han and Leia.  Thrawn is one of the great villains in Star Wars lore.  He is powerful, ambitious, and a fully realized villain.  He is worthy of opposing our heroes.  He may even overcome the New Republic and bring back the Empire.  This is his aim.In more than forty Star Wars novels that I have read ""Heir to the Empire"" is one of the best.  It is easy to see why Timothy Zahn was able to usher in this new era of Star Wars novels.  It is a well written book featuring our favorite characters in a new adventure and against new and interesting villains and characters.  Besides Thrawn, Zahn has also introduced  Karrde and Mara Jade, two more well written and interesting characters.  For the Star Wars fan this is essential reading.-Joe Sherry",5,"US"
2010-09-09,"A masterpiece","I first read this book 15 years ago, and it hasn't lost its magic. While much of the rest of the Star Wars Expanded Universe has become bogged down with irrelevant characters and unrealistic plot twists, Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire Trilogy actually manages to recapture the feeling of the original Star Wars trilogy. The original characters all play great roles and the ploy is well paced. More important, this book introduced several of the Expanded Universe's most beloved characters, from Mara Jade to Grand Admiral Thrawn. I personally love how Zahn spends so much time with the Imperials, using Captain Gilad Pellaeon as a narrative device to explain plot twists to the reader. This allows readers to appreciate Thrawn as a character, but also deftly manages to preserve some surprises. Overall, this trilogy is required reading for any Star Wars fan (the other books - not so much).",5,"US"
2010-02-16,"""A Jedi can't get so caught up in matters of galactic importance that it interferes with his concern for individual people""","""A Jedi can't get so caught up in matters of galactic importance that it interferes with his concern for individual people""It's had a permanent space on my top books of all time, and there is a reason.  Considered by most Star Wars fans to be the best Star Wars Expanded Universe novel and the birth of Expanded Universe itself, Heir to the Empire takes off about 5 years after Return of the Jedi.Han and Leia are married and expecting twins.  Luke is a Jedi Knight.  And the New Republic is in its beginning stages.  But the Empire hasn't laid down to die yet.  A new threat arises, in a hidden Grand Admiral, Thrawn.  He has enlisted a mad Jedi Master clone, Joruus C'baoth, in his quest to destroy the Rebellion once and for all.I Liked:Where to begin?The Thrawn Trilogy (of which this is the first book) has been my favorite since I first read it way back when.  But as you grow up, your tastes often change.  I used to adore ""I, Jedi"" but when I reread it, there were some parts that I just couldn't enjoy as much as I did as a teen.  So I wanted to reread Heir, to see if I still felt the same way, if the book was as good as I remembered, if it still deserved its first place slot in favorite books.The answer to all three unspoken questions is the same.  Yes, yes, yes!Timothy Zahn is such an enjoyable author!  I love the way he writes; in my opinion, it is perfect for a Star Wars setting.  He is obviously knowledgeable about Star Wars (at this time, the only places he had to draw on were the Original movies, Splinter of the Mind's Eye and the Han Solo and Lando Adventure books) and it shows throughout.  Some say he dwells a little too often on movie events, but I think it is great.  The movies were such high points for the characters; no wonder they keep thinking of them as they go throughout this novel, as they experience similar (but not the same) events.Zahn has also managed to absolutely nail Han, Luke, and Leia, what I like to teasingly call the Trinity of Star Wars Expanded Universe.  Han remains the devilish scoundrel, but with more responsibility and maturity, like he was in Return of the Jedi.  Luke was done perfectly, an excellent Jedi, yet not so omniscient (like too many authors have done in more recent novels) that he can't be caught by a simple trick.  Leia is still stubborn, smart, and deeply in love with Han.  All in all, Zahn didn't fail me one bit.  As I read each one's point of view, it was easy to think I was in a Star Wars movie!Zahn's original characters also shine.  The devoted, non-power hungry Imperials, Paelleon and Thrawn, are well written.  They aren't stupid Imperials out for a land grab for the sake of a land grab.  They don't giggle their plots to everyone and his mother.  They don't plot evil wicked plans behind closed walls while drinking purple tea (ten points for the one who guesses which villain that represents).  They don't throw Star Destroyers pell-mell at the Republic with no plan.  They plot.  They scheme.  They move logically and methodically.  Therefore, since I happen to adore the Empire for some strange reason, I find they are probably the most competent Imperials in Star Wars Expanded Universe.As for Zahn's neutral characters, Mara Jade and Talon Karrde, I was equally impressed.  Mara Jade doesn't come off as a Leia clone nor does she strike me as a damsel in distress.  She obviously is cold and calculating, but is far from perfect.  Yeah, the red hair/green eyes combo wins her Mary Sue points, as does her angsty past, but somehow, she isn't annoying.  The whole world doesn't warp to her desires, so I can live with it.  As for Talon Karrde, again, we have a scoundrel, a mercenary who rises above the stupid villain caricature.Goodness!  All these words and I still haven't gotten to the meat of the book: the plot!  Again, showing Zahn's grasp for the Star Wars world, Timothy Zahn has written a story that, I feel, could be made into a Star Wars movie with very little manipulation.  It is that good.  Heck, sometimes, I swear I can hear the music!!  Our characters have motivations that make sense based on their characters (Leia being the diplomat and demanding to go to Bimmisari, Thrawn being thoughtful and calculating and ordering a three prong attack on  Bpfassh to test C'baoth, Luke when dealing with being held captive by Mara Jade and Talon Karrde).  People don't miraculously gain powers to suit the story's need.  There are space battles, attempted kidnappings, switching ships, villains, antagonists, aliens, distant planets, seedy spaceports...all perfect elements of a Star Wars novel.I Didn't Like:This will get petty, I warn you.The concept of the ysalamiri is best described in this quote from Talon Karrde (page 223): ""[The ysalamiri] seem to have the unusual ability to push back the Force--to create bubbles, so to speak, where the Force simply doesn't exist.""Well, based on the New Jedi Order (and the Yuuzhan Vong who didn't exist in the Force) and the Prequels (that say all living things have midichlorians, the building blocks of the Force), this seems rather odd.  Not to mention...if the Force didn't exist around these guys, wouldn't Luke have been able to sense the void of the Force?  However, I feel this ""error"" is more of an unclear view of the Force (Zahn wrote this in 1991 when Lucas probably had no clue what the heck the Force was) than a blatant disregard on the author's part.Zahn also has a tendency to write dialogue in the following manner: ""'Not here,' Ghent shook his head nervously...""  Shaking one's head, nodding, or sighing are NOT ways to express dialogue (I want to know how to nod out a word or to sigh out an entire sentence).  If Zahn had switched that comma to a period, then I would be sated and have nothing to complain about.  But I would be remiss if I didn't bring it up, as it was a little distracting to me.Lastly, I was not quite convinced with Zahn's characterization of Lando.  Not to say he was bad, but just that I felt that it was a bit off from the way he was in the movies.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:I can't recall a single foul word!Leia is pregnant?  Does that count?Well, there are space battles, an enlisted gets killed for an error, Thrawn is trying to kidnap Leia and Luke, and C'baoth is just a twinge mad...Overall:It's been a while since I read Heir to the Empire, and, to be honest, I was afraid it wouldn't be as good as I remembered.Well, nothing to fear!  Zahn truly captivated me all over again with this winning novel!  If George Lucas could take advice from him, maybe the Star Wars prequels would have turned out better!The only unfortunate thing is that the highest rating I can give is 5.  So 5 stars it is!  Thank you, Timothy Zahn, for making Star Wars come alive again!Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",5,"US"

2008-01-06,"Heir To A Good Read","I started reading this book about three years ago and within a month released I was just not in to it so I put it down and returned it to the library, disenchanted. I picked it up again recently and decided to give it another go. I don't know if it is because I am now more in to Star Wars then I was three years ago or what but this time I was totally entralled. THIS IS A VERY GOOD READ.The story line is well written. I like how the author kept very true to the characters we know from Episodes iv - vi and the way they are woven in to a very good story with the exciting new character of the Grand Admiral. Speaking of which, Grand Admiral Thrawn - Timothy Zahn, a connection perhaps?This is definitely a recommended read. Many reviewers consider this trilogy to be one of the better ones and I can see why. I give it only 4 stars because of the fact it didn't get me first time around but once it did it stuck. If you are a fan of Star Wars you will be a fan of this book.",4,"US"
2007-11-13,"Has its moments","I normally do not read derivative fiction, but I like the Star Wars universe, and Zahn's books have been recommended to me for years.  The biggest problem I have with his writing is he seriously overuses certain phrases and words, and this persists throughout the trilogy.  I won't say what they are, in hopes that you won't notice.  Another small objection - as someone who has seen the original Star Wars trilogy countless times, whenever a character says something in these books that they said in the movie, it really jumps out at me, and if it's a stretch to make them say it in the particular situation, it's really obvious.  There were several such points in the Thrawn Trilogy.  What Zahn was good at was setting a good pace, believable characterization, generally good dialogue, a competence at describing settings, and generally good plotlines.  A couple of the main characters were weakly drawn, but were not distractingly bad.  Overall I found the whole trilogy fairly enjoyable.",3,"US"
1998-12-10,"one of the best sci-fi novels ever","This has to be the best star wars book out there. Zahn captures the action, ezcitment, and mystery of the movies.  1) Sophisticated language makes a good book. It adds that intellignet feeling to it.  2) The intent, from my perspective, in not  saying what happened to the other Grand Admirals was to allow other authors  the chance to elaborate on that. Personally, I like my novels with that  kind mystery in them  3) I'm 13 years old, 11 when I read the book, and I  understood what ""cocking and eyebrow"" meant. I read that  terminallagy all the time. If you adults can't see the obvious, it's not  Zahn's fault  4) At the Battle of Endor, the EXECUTER was destroyed. Zahn  explains quite clearly how a good deal of the Empire's best and brightest  were on it. He said it was the fast track to premotion, and remember, Vader  was the Emperor's right hand man. He could have gotten anyone he wanted on  his own personal Star Destroyer.  5) In the novels preceding Heir to the  Empire, the Empire suffered defeat after defeat at the Alliance's hands. It  is perfectly pluasible that the Empire didn't have alot of ships.  Heir  to the Empire was an excellent book. Zahn receives applause from not only  me, but the thousands of others who enjoyed his novels. I would suggest  reading the other two novels in this trilogy, and reading the Hand of  Thrawn books.",5,"US"
2015-11-20,"Well Done","I very much enjoyed this book. Unlike some of the other books in the series, it's mostly action with politics playing in the background (as opposed to the other way around). The characters were well and richly drawn, the story tight and realistic. It's one of those books where events happen very fast; it covers a relatively short time span, but a lot happens. It made me laugh out loud several times, and cringe on the character's behalf at others. I look forward to picking up the next book.",4,"US"
2008-07-28,"Superb kickoff to a great trilogy set five years after Return of the Jedi","The cornerstone of the modern Star Wars Expanded Universe, Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire was published in 1991 in an environment where Star Wars was considered a dusty relic of the 70s and 80s, except to some die-hard enthusiasts. At least, that was the perception going around. The reality was there was enough latent interest in the franchise to send this book soaring up the New York Times bestseller lists. I remember at the time believing there would never be any more Star Wars films and that this trilogy would act as a surrogate Episodes VII, VIII, and IX. Well, here we are eighteen years later and we've gotten three (soon to be four with the animated Clone Wars) more films, but still no sign of the infamous sequel trilogy. So, for the time being, perhaps the Thrawn Trilogy can be considered the closest thing we've got.In light of that, the great news is this is one of the best books of the Expanded Universe and also one of its most cinematic. Zahn moved the timeline forward to five years after Return of the Jedi, and in doing so permitted the main characters to develop beyond what we saw in the films. Han and Leia are married with twin children on the way, and Luke is laying the groundwork for the future course of the Jedi. All the usual sidekicks are back and true to their film selves.The key, though, is the new villain Zahn introduces, Grand Admiral Thrawn. Thrawn is a character of chilling intelligence, methodically plotting and executing a return to power for the scattered remnants of the Empire. He is ably assisted by Captain Pellaeon and a well-trained Imperial force of warships and troopers. Thrawn's earliest appearance in the Expanded Universe chronologically was in the excellent novel Outbound Flight, set decades earlier. Heir to the Empire does not reveal much of the intervening decades in his life but readers of the other book will immediately recognize the portrayal and development of Thrawn here.Another significant addition to the Star Wars galaxy in this book is Mara Jade, former Emperor's Hand and Force user turned smuggler. Mara is a strong character who tends to dominate any scene she's in, but she makes a great foil to Luke Skywalker. They are connected by surprising events from the past, casting a new light on the battle at the Pit of Carkoon in Return of the Jedi. Mara's adversarial relationship to Luke creates many opportunities for growth in both her and Luke and Zahn handles this well.The best thing about Thrawn is he brings a true sense of danger that was lacking in the Empire's leaders since the Battle of Endor. Ysanne Isard was smart and malicious but lacked a sweeping vision. Warlord Zsinj was somewhat clever but also a bit silly and trite. The New Republic has faced many other opponents but not any with the potential for complete ruin that Thrawn brings. The addition of the rogue Jedi Joruus C'baoth to Thrawn's forces completes building the most credible threat the fledging government has faced in the Expanded Universe.The storyline itself works well both as a largely standalone episode, not dissimilar to A New Hope, but also in planting the seeds for the two sequels. The storyline itself is well-crafted and marries perfectly with Zahn's strong characterizations. This book is essential reading for any fan wanting to enter the Star Wars Expanded Universe but also continues to be a rewarding read for fans saturated in the tales of that galaxy far, far away.",5,"US"
2002-09-03,"The Graphic Novel of the Movie.","This is a graphic novel of the movie THE ATTACK OF THE CLONES. That pretty much sums everything up. However, being a graphic novel there are two major elements the book can be judged upon, art and story.The art is very photorealistic and cinematic. There is a lot of detail and color. I must admit, I like the artistic style of the Marvel comics of the original trilogy much better than the photorealistic style of this book. However, for the style it is illustrated in, it is done quite well.Story wise, the book stays pretty faithful to the movie. There are a few omissions from the film here, but there are also a few added scenes here that are not in the movie. A lot of the dialogue is taken directly from the film's script and though cheesy, reminds one of the language of the original trilogy.This is something that most Star Wars fans will enjoy having and reading and works well as a memento to someone who hasn't seen ATTACK OF THE CLONES to perhaps get them excited enough to do so.",4,"US"
1996-12-27,"Zahn's Trilogy Not Quite Worthy of the Star Wars Title","Timothy Zahn's books ""Heir to the Empire"", ""Dark ForceRising"", and ""The Last Command"" are good books, don't get mewrong. I just don't think they measure up to the Star Wars mythos. Characterization is poor. All of the characters sound exactly alike. Without the phrases ""said Luke"" or ""Han shouted"", I wouldn't have been able to tell one guy from the other. I found Han saying things that I just couldn't imagine Harrison Ford saying, and it was the same way with Luke, Leia, Lando, etc. Another thing that irked me was the way the characters kept finishing each other's sentences. After three books of this, one may become rather annoyed. Some of the original characters are uninteresting as well. While the plot was fast-paced and entertaining, the reader doesn't get the full Star Wars experience. Zahn should have paid more attention to characters and dialogue.",4,"US"
2008-01-11,"The New Empire","In the first book of the ""Thrawn Trilogy"", Grand Admiral Thrawn takes the reigns of the Empire.  One of the most compelling aspects of the plots of the Star Wars series is the villains.  Without Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader, the movie plots may not have been as successful.  As the main of the ""Thrawn Trilogy"", Thrawn is portrayed as a tactical genius.  In comparison to other villains in the Star Wars galaxy, he does seem a tad dull.Among the highlights of this book is the conflicts with the ""gray aliens"" and unlikely alliance with smuggler Talon Karrde on Myrkr.  The resolution with the aliens may be surprising to some.  Karrde brings a past foe to Luke's present that puts a different spin on the fall of the old Empire.  I am intrigued to see this relationship to develop in other parts of the series.  Vaguely introduced in this book is Jorus C'baoth, who is likely the clone of a deceased Jedi.  Since he is almost a minor character in this book, I suspect he will play a more prominent role in the other books.I was very close to giving this book five stars.  The slower moments with Thrawn prevented me from doing so.  The main villain in this series needs to get the readers attention.  In this book, I never felt the same threat as other villains because he seems little more than a ""military geek"".  Still, I am excited to read the other books in the series.",4,"US"
2009-01-14,"A great start to the Thrawn Trilogy","Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn is the first book in a series that has come to be referred to as the Thrawn Trilogy. That is as it should be because Grand Admiral Thrawn is one of the best villains in the entire Expanded Universe and this is one of the best books.Our timeline is approximately five years after Return of the Jedi, so our favorite characters are still around, just five years down the road. Han and Leia have twins on the way. Luke is trying to establish a direction for the Jedi movement. Other favorites also have roles to play, but Thrawn steals the show. You can't help but be impressed by him even though he is one of the bad guys. His intelligence is overwhelming. He always seems to be at least one step ahead of everybody else. Captain Pellaeon, the commander of Thrawn's flagship, is constantly trying to understand the rationale behind the orders he receives. Thrawn is the last of the Emperor's warlords, and he has taken command of the remains of the Imperial fleet. His goal, in short, is to do what the Emperor failed to do, i.e., destroy the Republic. Mara Jade also is an important presence in Heir to the Empire. She is the former Emperor's Hand and a Force user, so her skills are considerable. One other character who has sided with Thrawn is Joruus C'baoth, a strange Jedi with a prickly personality and significant powers in the Force.This book was first published in 1991 and was like a breath of fresh air for Star Wars fans who were missing the films. They could pull for their heroes again. Heir to the Empire is an excellent read on its own, but it also does a fine job of leading into the next two books in the trilogy. This is a must read for any Star wars fan.",5,"US"
2006-11-01,"An EXCELLENT Star Wars Novel","I read this book on a recommendation from a friend when I decided to join the Expanded Universe of Star Wars.  It, by far, was the best recommendation I have received for a book in a long, long time.  Timothy Zahn is an excellent story teller who immerses you in the Star Wars universe.  He doesn't bog down the story with techno-babble that can break up the flow of many a sci-fi story.  Not that he abandons it, either.  There is a lot of information to be gleaned from his knowledge of SW Technology.  Lastly, the character development shows a true understanding of the Star Wars characters.My only word of caution to you linear thinkers: This story was written almost a decade before Episodes I - III.  Zahn extrapolated story lines that have become inconsistent with Lucas' story line since the release of the films, but if you can get over that, you are in for a sure treat!",5,"US"
2009-01-24,"Episode VII anyone... yeah its that good","I've been watching Star Wars episodes (4-6) throughout my entire childhood. At the end of this incessant compulsion there used to be an empty feeling that has now been finally relieved. In Heir to the Empire Timothy Zahn (Hugo award winning author, trust me it's a big deal) delivers a staunch continuation into the Star Wars universe. He has brought forth a new trilogy and really starts it off with a bang. Zhan gives the reader a new story using the entire surviving old cast. He excels at maintaining Luke, the droids, the Wookie and the rest of the gangs classic personality while still creating new and interesting feats and growths for all these characters. There is a plethora of new villains, old heroes and some that are in-between. All of which fit perfectly in the star wars universe and are just as interesting or more so than some of classic icons e.g. Darth Vader.Story (thrilling fun): Zahn starts us off five years after the battle of Endor. Han and Leia are married awaiting twins. Leia has under gone her apprentice as a Jedi and is gifted to say the least. Luke's a very powerful Jedi but not without limits or the need for assistance from time to time. The New Republic founder's (which includes our gang) are finding that maintaining their new leviathan of a government is nothing short of grueling. There also finding that just as the empire wasn't impervious to falling neither are they.  The Empire is all but vanquished and beaten down but still holds considerable array of personnel and star ships. Plus a new Grand Admiral has trickled from the shadows thus giving us a story. His razor sharp cunning puts the Republics ability to maintain control into question along with giving Luke and the gang a whole new set of quests and adventures to overcome. Overall this gripping story is just as much fun as watching its predecessors.Descriptions (lush): Zahn is simply an artist at painting exotic scenes that let my imagination be utterly entertained. His ability to provided vivid atmospheres really took this book to the next level. Zhan delivered time and time again whether conveying the ambiance of a star destroyer bridge, the swagger of fan favorite Han Solo or the urgency to survive in a hostile forest.Originality (fresh): Zahn delves deep into galactic politics creating a broader space opera than ever before. There's new vicious species along with curiously gifted ones. Not to mention several well thought out diabolical schemes for the surviving Empire. Zahn ideas at times are flat out genius while others are nothing short of well crafted. I'm mainly impressed with Grand Admiral Thrawn who is the Empire's new glowing red eyed commander and the reader's new villain to love. Then coming out of woodwork is Mara Jade a female force to be reckoned with. Her closet is overflowing with secrets (don't worry no spoilers here) that really keep the story full of surprises. So much more but I don't want to ruin any of this instant classic fresh spins and turns.Final thoughts (this is episode VII):  If you love Star Wars this is really episode 7. It's as great as your imagination can handle and lives up to all the hype. For non-sci-fi readers or non-Star Wars fans this may not be for you yet if that is your M.O. I'm perplexed as to why you're even reading this review. This is solid book from character development down to plot and has excellent re-readability. To sum this up this is one of my all time favorite reads and authors. The real Heir to the Empire is Timothy Zahn.",5,"US"
2017-01-28,"I also purchased the 20th anniversary edition and I'm glad I did","Although I own the original ""Heir to the Empire"" book, I also purchased the 20th anniversary edition and I'm glad I did.  It's hard to explain how exciting and thrilling it was in 1991 to get this fantastic continuation of the Star Wars saga.  I loved revisiting the story along with the notes in this edition  The Legends Expanded Universe is my continuation of the story after ""Return of the Jedi"", not whatever crap Disney does.  So fun to revisit Luke, Han and Leia and be introduced to the great characters of Mara Jade, Thrawn, Pellaeon, Talon Karrde and others, with so many great stories yet to come.",5,"US"
2018-09-01,"Great narrator, cinematic sound, and awesome story deserving of the name Star Wars!","I loved the story and the narrator. He does the voices of the characters so well, and then the music and sound effects (straight from the movies!) make the whole book seem cinematic. I'm glad I got this, and will get the rest of the trilogy next.",5,"US"
2009-08-12,"If only they would make this trilogy into movie format...","I've read many of the Star Wars books that tried to carry on the dream world that was so great for many of us from the movies. Of all the stories I've read, I believe whole-heartedly that this trilogy is the best. I love how it picked up immediately after the Emperor's fall and how high commands of the Empire had not gotten word that the Empire was defeated and could not/would not believe it. Grand Admiral Thrawn is one of the greatest characters I know of in the entire Star Wars universe. His character and command was amazing and seemed to show how even without the Emperor or Darth Vader the Empire was still quite capable of defeating the Rebels. I remember reading these books years ago and after the new movies (I, II, and III) came out I was hoping someone would see the potential of this storyline. Even if the story by Timothy Zahn is never brought to the big screen, it is worth the read. But I imagine afterwards you too will wish it was in the works in Hollywood.",5,"US"
1998-02-20,"A perfect example of why Zahn is a Hugo winner","I loved this book (and the entire trilogy)! The ""Heir to the Empire"" is the best SW novel I have read and one of the best sci-fi novels I have read in a long time. The characters (both old and new) are well-developed and interesting. Leia, Luke, and Han remained in character. I could hear the actors' voices saying their lines. I don't usually like the villians, but I made an exception in this case. I loved Mara Jade and her interaction with Luke was wonderful. Admiral Thawn was a wonderful adversary. As much as I hated him I also grudgingly respected him. The strategy match between the Alliance and Thawn was engaging. I like seeing competent bad guys. Sometimes the Imperials seem to have left their brain at home. This book is a worthwhile read whether you are a casual fan or a major fan. Also, check out some of Zahn's other books. The author has definite talent.",5,"US"
2002-12-31,"Thrawn, A Worthy Heir","The Star Wars universe succeeds or fails with it's villian.  Vader made the films.  Maul redeemed an easily criticized Episode I.  Zahn delivers to the fans a cerebral, cultured, and unique Heir to the imperial remnant with Thrawn.As I rolled through this book, I longed for this to be the cinematic heir to Return of the Jedi (as I read this the first time in high school, long before Ep I).  The characters are intriging, the settings are fresh, and our old favorites are once again brough to us as if we just left the celebration on Endor.This was the first book I read from the expanded Star Wars universe.  I have read every hard cover since and many of the paperbacks.  And that is 100% due to how good a book (and a trilogy) Zahn has written.I'm not a Star Wars Novel mark (although I am a huge fan) There have been awful novels.  This one though is awesome.Read it.  And be prepared to anticipate the next book as much as you anticipated the movie back in the late 70's and early 80's.",5,"US"
2013-07-31,"The Book That Solidified the Star Wars EU","While not the first Star Wars book by many years (the novelization of the first movie came out prior to the first movie), this is the book that pushed to make the EU a concerted effort, not the scattered mishmash it had been up until that point.  Released in 1991, the book not only updated readers on their favorite characters from the original trilogy, but it also introduced such pivotal EU characters as Mara Jade, Admiral Thrawn and the Solo twins, Jaina and Jacen. Set 9 ABY, the Empire has continued to fall apart as the New Republic struggles to grow.  A new Imperial evil named Thrawn is set to regain any ground lost w/ Palpatine's demise.

2011-11-02,"Good Story.","This is the first Star Wars book to tell a story after Return Of The Jedi. Letting you know, I have never read any of the author's other works. At least, none that weren't Star Wars. The story is that the galaxy has been at peace for five years, owing to the defeat of Darth Vader and The Emperor. Then an ex-Imperial general named Thrawn comes into the picture, with a plot involving a Jedi Master who has been missing since the beginning of the Clone Wars. His plot also has to do with creatures resistent to The Force and manipulation of Luke Skywalker. Yeah, it's crazy, but it's fun. If you are just starting to read Star Wars novels, this is a good one to begin with. As a note: this is the first part of a trilogy.",5,"US"

But I did get the comics as they came and this is just a collection of those.The adaptation from the Zahn novels to comics were just kind of okay. The artwork was good but not exceptional. Because they did each book in the trilogy in about 6 issues, you're left kind of wanting. If you've never read the books (Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, and The Last Command) you might come away from this a little confused. They had to leave out most subplots and some character development because of space.Basically, it gave us a visual guide to the original novels. I always enjoy seeing artists take on these characters. But if you really want to enjoy the story, buy the books and then get this.My humble opinion.",3,"US"

""Heir"" may be my favorite, though, as it does such a wonderful job of reminding us why Star Wars is such a brilliant story to begin with while at the same time introducing us to new characters that just fit right in with the classic ones we know and love already.",5,"US"
2000-03-03,"Multiple Plots Combine For a Good Ending.","This novel was a strange read.  I have been a huge fan of the Star Wars films and have read the four novelizations of the films that have been currently released.  I liked them and found they fleshed out the films  well.This is the first Star Wars novel that isn't already a film that I  have read.  It took getting used to.At first I was apprehensive about  all these new characters that were being introduced in the novel.  I  figured who cares?  I wanted to read about Han, Leia, Luke, Chewie, etc.  Not these new guys Mara, Thrawn, etc.The writing style took some getting  used to for me as well.  Starting from the very beginning of the novel you  get short little blurbs of what is happening to a character and the plot  that is happening, then it would switch to a different character's story,  then another, then yet another.  It led to me not really caring about any  of the characters until I had enough information (which was over halfway  through the novel).After the halfway mark I find I must have finally  accepted and begun to like the new characters in the story.  The major  contributing factor that this was the turning point in the story was the  combining of the individual character's stories.  Mara ran into Luke, Han  and Lando ran into Mara and Luke, the only person not really reunited near  the end was Leia.Perhaps that's why I really enjoyed the ending as  everyone was practically involved.  It was action intense and hyped me for  the next novel.  If not for the last half of the novel, I don't think I  would continue woth this series, but the slow combination of separate plots  made this novel interesting.  It just took a while to get used to the new  characters and read the Star Wars series 'in a straight novel form'.",3,"US"

I was one of those insane adults in line with my lightsaber and gown waiting to see Attack of The Clones on openning night. I haven't grown up yet at the age of hmmm... and I still love star wars! This is a must book for the true star wars geek. I was at first hesitant to read this book because I fiqured it was just a spin off from the movie. However two of my cousins, who are also star wars geeks ( one an anynomous book-worm, the other an anynomous actuary), recommended this book to me. So I gave it a try and loved it almost as passionatlely as the star wars trilogy. I loved this book so much I would say it definitely was Hugo material.

2015-01-26,"Still THE continuation of the Star Wars Saga","I know I'm not the only one who wouldn't hesitate to declare Zahn the undisputed king of the Expanded Universe and this series his masterpiece. It is pacy, well written, and full of the type of action that any Star Wars fan should love. Zahn has also managed to create, IMHO, the most compelling, badass villain in the entire Star Wars universe for this series: Grand Admiral Thrawn. He is the epitome of a cold, calculating, brilliant mastermind that keeps you reading on to see what he will come up with next. With him, Zahn shows that one doesn't need to be a Sith Lord to be a very interesting and entertaining villain. Anyway, I really can't recommend Heir to the Empire (and the rest of the trilogy) highly enough, and I hope that I'm also not the only one that cringed when he discovered that Disney was casting this series (and the rest of the EU) by the wayside in the continuation of the movies. *Sigh* It's a shame, but who knows, maybe they will come up with something good.

There's only  one thing that I don't like too much: Grand admiral Thrawn is darn smart.  I have no clue, how he guesses all these things. But probably that's just  one of his secret things. Maybe this will be explained in the sequel I'm  just reading. Otherwise there is no other thing that i would find wrong.

When the New Republic face Ysanne  Isard, Admiral Daala, the reborn Emperor, or Warlord Zsinj, I never have  any doubts that the Empire is going to lose. Then I read about Grand  Admiral Thrawn. The guy is amazing. He has everyone figured out and the  Rebels are running around in circles. C'baoth is a perfect balance to  Thrawn's style. One is so refined and so calm, the other is a raging  lunatic with a very strange way of seeing things. Talon Karrde and Mara  Jade are great, too.  Talk about smugglers with depth. The battle of Sluis  Van gives the Rebels a victory, but for how long. Thrawn will return!",5,"US"
2000-11-02,"NOBODY does it better than Zahn---except for Lucas himself","Being a hard-core Star Wars fan since '77, I was thrilled but cautious when 'Heir To The Empire' first came out.  I had read 'Splinter of the Mind's Eye', the FIRST Star Wars novel outside of the original trilogy books (which ALL stink, by the way) and although it was entertaining, it just seemed like a story with characters who had the same names as Leia & Luke & Darth etc. There was no real substance that tied the 'spirit' of the movies to the book.  But even so, I gave Timothy Zahn a shot, and all I can say is WOW!  He has captured the very 'essence' of Star Wars PERFECTLY.  IF George Lucas ever decided to make Episode 7, 8 & 9 he would start with 'Heir' for sure.  I don't think even HE could improve upon his own stories any better than Zahn has.  Everything from Grand Admiral Thrawn (a fantastic character, and MUCH more depth than Darth or the Emperor) to the Emperor's Hand, Mara Jade, to the ingenious introduction of creatures that actually REPEL the Force, this book and it's incredible sequels are NOT to be missed.  If you have EVER wondered if there were novels about the Star Wars Universe that were every bit as good as the movies, than Zahn is your author and the next series you read should start with 'Heir To The Empire'.  I have read and re-read this series 3 times now, and each time I find something new to remember, and another reason to be impressed with Zahn's writing style and ability.  I have also read almost all of the 'other' Star Wars novels out there (since a rash of them have been published since the completion of 'The Last Command') and there are but a small few that are even worthy of the Star Wars name, and none of THEM even rival THIS series by Zahn.  I'm telling ya, THIS is IT!  Ever wonder where Lucas came up with the name for the Imperial world, 'Coroscant'?  He BORROWED it from Zahn (no joke).  I figure if you don't read this series, you just CAN'T be a serious fan of Star Wars...but if you ARE, don't put off grabbing this entire series ASAP.  It's just fantastic Space Opera.  Go ahead, give it a shot.  Read book 1, enjoy.  Go to book 2, repeat.  Etc.",5,"US"
2018-01-13,"One happy Star Wars fan!","The book is incredible. Not perfect but damn close for me. I have not yet finished the trilogy so it feels like this book does a lot of building up for what is to come. Regardless the situations are tense and thrilling. This book kept me at the edge of my seat for pretty much the entire time reading. Definitely a must read.",5,"US"
2006-06-26,"Good Story. Great New Characters","This book was very entertaining with some new characters that I like very much, like Mara Jade and Talon Karde. The main villain in the story is the Grand Admiral Thrawn. I thought the Grand Admiral was a great villain for this story. He was very smart and very dangerous. His goal, of course, is to bring the galaxy under the control of the Empire.This book has new characters, new worlds, and new aliens. All of which are fun to read about. There were a couple of things that I thought were kind of unbelievable, even in the context of a Star Wars story. I thought the ysalimari were kind of dumb and as clever as the Grand Admiral was, there were times when he just jumped to some wild conclusions that didn't really seem to hold with me. But I was able to overlook these limitations since the rest of the story was so enjoyable and so well written.",4,"US"
2012-05-23,"It's like seeing it in 1977 all over again","The Heir to the Empire and it's two companion books stand as the benchmark by which all Star Wars novels are judged. That's not just my opinion look up the reviews from 20 years ago. Add to that the fact that George Lucas has included characters from Timothy Zahn novels in his video games. This trilogy of books ""The Thrawn Trilogy"" pick up our heroes 5 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. The Empire has been pushed back, way back. But now his under the command of the only surviving Grand Admiral in the Empire. Luke, Leah, Han, Lando, Chewbacca and the Droids are forced once more into danger. They must fight for the New Republic still trying to organize a new government.These Books are so far from normal Sci-Fi of fight scenes the no emotional under pining. You really feel for these character and their struggles. And this is one of the best Audio books I've ever owned period. Extremely well done with music and sound effects. It is a little like listening to a radio drama only it's the unabridged novel. Fantastic, Wonderful, Awesome, Gripping, Heart Pounding, Funny, Moving. Please do yourself a favor... Buy this",5,"US"
2014-04-15,"Cheap antagonist.","Grand Admiral Thrawn is the head honcho that takes over the Imperial Fleet after the Battle of Endor.  He's supposed to be this brilliant tactician.  However, he seems to know just a bit too much.  He doesn't use the force, yet somehow seems to know every move the Rebels are going to make.  Sure, the Empire has its spies, but Thrawn seems to be omnipotent when it comes to strategy.  Without explanation, he's always three moves ahead.  ""Oh, that's the Rebel's REAL target"" and ""The commander of the fleet is this general....oh, he just stepped down, not it's THIS general.""  How could he possibly know all this?  Understanding battle tactics is one thing, and having insight is another thing, but being able to dictate every move at every moment is a bit much.  Sometimes, he even predicts the Rebel's movements before THEY EVEN THINK OF IT!  He'll stare out the window of his Star Destroyer, looking at a fleet of Rebel cruisers....he'll rub his chin....and magically know the next ten things about to happen.  ""Those X wings are going to bank left, then right, then retreat, then attack.""  It's almost as if he's read the book before the reader got to it.  Great trilogy, cheap protagonist.",3,"US"
1999-01-06,"The Force was definitely with Zahn when he wrote this.","Heir to the Empire, and the rest of the books in this series, are phenomenal.  Timothy Zahn gets the magic of the Star Wars universe down pat.  The characters from the movie are true to character, and the new  characters that he creates fit in so well with the Star Wars universe that  if I didn't know better, I'd think George Lucas himself might have come up  with them.  A few other Star Wars authors could definitely learn from him.  It's also the kind of book that you can read over and over again, and still  not lose interest in it.  Not only that, but I liked the fact that I  couldn't guess where the plot was going while I was reading; Zahn had me in  suspense the whole time.  The Force was definitely with Zahn when he wrote  these books.",5,"US"

2005-01-17,"Heir to Star Wars","Heir to the Empire is a guns balzing, riproaring adventure that is worthy of the Star Wars name.  Zahn's plot makes perfect sense and fits wonderfully into the Star Wars universe.  The Rebels (now the New Republic) are still mopping up after Endor, and the political climate is difficult as well.  The plot moves wonderfully and leaves the reader craving more.  I love the intirgue and the new characters in this book.  Honestly, what captured me the most was Zahn's perfect protrayal of the core classic characters.  He is right on the money.  One can almost hear them speaking.  It is truly too bad that these books can not be made into films.  The actors are now to aged to do so, and it would not really work.  However, an animated series would be outstanding...especially if Lucas could get the actors to return to protray they own voices. The book is tremendous, and it is just what Star Wars fans will love.  Great battles, inner sturggles, politics, and of course a new super cool villian to strive against.  ""The force is with this one!""",5,"US"
2003-06-02,"Zahn is a good author!","Set five years after Return of the Jedi, this tale tells about the struggles of a new government (The New Republic) led by Mon Mothma. Grand Admiral Thrawn is the leader of the fleeting Empire, and proves that he, indeed is worthy of that title. He is cunning, and impressively intelligent, not wasteful of personell, quite opposite of the way Darth Vader would handle things. Talon Karrde, the successor to Jabba The Hutt's group is mentioned, and so is Mara Jade, as Karrde's sidekick. This is a great book, and mentions a Dark Jedi, Joruus C'baoth, a clone. It brings up several interesting ideas as tohow some things work.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE, EVERYONE, AND OTHER PEOPLE TOOSo go read it, NOW!.",5,"US"
2013-02-12,"Seriously Luke is awesome","Heir to the empire is an awesome continuation of the Star Wars series. Set 5 years after Return of the Jedi, Leia is pregnant with twins and their is a new threat out to harm her. It takes Luke, Han, and Chewie to protect our princess. Along the way they find old friends that help, and new enemies that make it a lot harder to protect everything Luke and Leia have accomplished over the years. The author did a good job telling this story, however he seems to use the phrase ""the other"" way too often. Other than that I do recommend this book to all Star Wars fans.",4,"US"
2001-06-18,"The Gang is Back in Action","This book was awesome. It was the first Star Wars book I read outside of the original trilogy and I was blown away. I read the entire thing in one day. Zahn does an amazing job working within the SW universe. He adds some new characters, but never did I feel like he was going outside the boundaries set by Lucas. There weren't any far fetched storlines like I've heard about some other authors. You'll genuinely believe this is what happens after Jedi, and it will play itself out the way a SW fan always thought it would with non-stop action and suspense. It won't disappoint. The second and third installments by Zahn are just as just as amazing. You have to read them all to really understand how magnificent and complex the story Zahn has woven really is. And for a treat, check out the graphic novel adaptations by Dark Horse comics. All the fun of the novel with incredible art to guide you.",5,"US"
2000-11-06,"Are The Yuuzhan Vong Getting You Down?","Perhaps you miss Chewbacca, or the earlier years when Star Wars seemed a bit simpler, and no one felt the need to start pruning central and favorite characters, in order to make ""Science Fiction"" more realistic. Or maybe you need to brush up on which Grand Admiral was causing trouble for planets after studying with his glowing red eyes their art, as a prelude to their destruction. And do you recall which sessile tree-dwelling creatures made their debut or the Planet that was their home, or perhaps the smuggler who also resided there.I just wanted to go back to where the Star wars experience continued, to the summer of 1991, and the first trilogy written by Timothy Zahn. I wanted to see how well this volume held up after almost a decade, and dozens upon dozens of books, and one prequel later.The effect is rather jarring, and it is only not due to Chewbacca's presence, or the amount of action that takes place on his home planet of Kashyyyk.  The Star Wars Universe described some 9 years ago for readers, that documented events only 5 years after Episode VI, really is a very different place. The cast of players is dramatically fewer, and I gained even more appreciation for just how complex the latest novels have become.I also suggest that for those who became fans of the written adventures later on in their development, that they would gain a much better grounding by reading these first books that take place after the middle cinematic trilogy. Many of the players in this first book continue on to the most recent ""Balance Point"" by Kathy Tyers. And others, who also remain, have evolved so far as to be unrecognizable, if you knowledge of them is limited to the more recent books.I know there are fans out there that have never forgotten a single detail of any adventure. I wish I could claim such an accurate memory. This book sat on a shelf for 9 years, and while the read was very different, it was still very enjoyable. The only element that has diminished is that when this book first arrived, it was the first fresh experience for all who had been with the series since 1977, and for those who had never seen the films.Diminished may be too strong a word, for Mr. Zahn is one of the masters of the Star Wars history, and excellent writing rarely degrades with time.So get it, or read again what you may have owned for a decade. Travel back to Mount Tantiss, and the figure that calls it home, and your subsequent reads will be improved.",5,"US"
2006-06-08,"Clonewars","Do you want ot read a great series book that was so good that it was made into a movie? Then pick up the book Starwars 2: Attack of the Clones. Every chapter there is something going on, even in the first chapter. It has loads of mysteries and fighting. The Jedis have to find an assassin. Even if you have seen the movie it is still an exciting book to read. if you want a few more details than the movie had, you better definitely read this book. It is not hard to read and is fun to read also. The book is Sci-fi and is very creative. It takes you away to a far away land, in a different galaxy. There are wars, guns, and robots. If you like all of these things, be sure to pick up this book!",4,"US"
1999-09-16,"ABSOLUTELY SUPERB CONTINUATION OF THE STAR WARS SAGA!","Timothy Zhan's Heir to the Empire is nothing short of a masterpiece! Grand Admiral Thrawn's presence becomes almost tangible for the enthusiastic reader. The novel is superbly crafted, so as to always keep the reader  involved in the story. There are no boring filler sections, but instead a  constantly evolving plot that one enjoys keeping up with. Zahn's clear  presentation of the Star Wars characters makes it feel like one is totally  esconched in a movie! Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, and The Last  Command, and also Specter of the Past and Vision of the Future, all stand  at the top of the pyramid of Star Wars books. Definitely read these books  for an awesome trip to a galaxy far, far away!",5,"US"
2002-04-24,"Beyond The Menace","If anyone was worried about the Star Wars franchise, relax. Because if this graphic novel translates well into film (or digital videotape as the case is with this installment) than we are in for something more intense than the previous four films have been.  This graphic novel outlines the story quite well and tells us nicely how the Republic makes its subtle change from a democracy to a dictatorship. Obi-Wan Kenobi continues his training of Anakin Skywalker and unwittingly walks into galactic civil war as the mechanisations of the Sith engulf the galaxy.  To say more would be telling. But I will say the art in this graphic novel is very well done. The ships, the characters, the aliens, and especially Jango Fett are rendered very well. My only complaint is that I remember the ""Empire Strikes Back"" version done by Marvel Comics, and I miss that style. But...I guess I'm getting old.  Nonetheless, this is a worthy catch, even if it lacks the old comic book feel that I remember when I was seven years old.",4,"US"

An unique character and with addition stories by Zahn flushing out his character he is more of an anti-hero than villain. Reuniting all main characters of Star Wars in the conflict against the remains of the empire, while trying to create a new government and society. Also introduces Mara Jade, one of the most conflicted characters in the expanded universe and one of the best female characters. Mara Jade adds a nice counter balance to Luke and the two have many great interactions with one another. Overall this is the book to read to get into the expanded universe if for no other reason than Thrawn and Mara.",5,"US"
2012-01-22,"Enjoyed the book; probably won't be reading the sequels","I recently read Heir to the Empire to get me in a Star Wars mood for The Old Republic (the Star Wars MMO). I liked the book. It was a fun, galaxy-spanning space opera (which there seem to be all too few of these days). I don't, however, think I will be picking up the next books in the series. The problem? The films. For one thing, the goofier aspects of the films (ewoks, etc.) cannot be ignored. More significantly, it means that characters from the films are sacrosanct, and cannot really grow or be challenged (much less killed). Luke, Leia, Han, etc. are all altruistic saints; there can be no grey areas with them. As a result, there's no suspense as to the eventual outcome; however brilliant Thrawn may be, he will be overcome through charity and good works. As a kid, this was fine. As an adult, it means I identify much more with the bad guys, who, as mere flawed mortals, must use the mundane traits of intelligence, courage, and dedication to do battle with our magical ubermensch heroes. When you start to empathize more with the faceless stormtroopers than with the Jedi Knight who slaughters them, I think it's safe to say you've moved beyond the Star Wars universe. Ah well, it was fun while it lasted.",3,"US"
2011-05-09,"A pure pleasure to read","It's rare for me these days to find a book that doesn't pull me out of the narrative in some way due to stilted, clunky sentences, flat characterizations or nonsensical plot devices. Timothy Zahn's ""Heir to the Empire"" (the first book in the Thrawn Trilogy) was a pure pleasure to read, keeping me immersed and enthralled throughout.Zahn's great strength in writing for the Star Wars Expanded Universe is his characterization. It's certainly tricky to take another person's creation and keep it faithful to the original without courting stagnation, but when it comes to the Lucas canon characters (such as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo), he nails it every time - I can actually hear the actors reciting his lines. Zahn's original characters are equally vibrant and complex: Grand Admiral Thrawn is every inch the masterful, iconic villain that Darth Vader was, with more polished nuance and none of the ""He's a good guy, then a bad guy, then a good guy"" sort of simplistic all-or-nothing categorizing that plagues other material in the canon.The narrative flows very well; writing is crisp and tight where it needs to be while leaving plenty of room for detailed exposition. I did find that pacing wasn't always even, since both riveting action sequences and slower but plot-crucial diplomatic scenes are peppered throughout all three books. The storyline has enough twists and turns to keep the reader invested while avoiding overuse of the idiot ball - surprises still keep the plot moving in a plausible direction rather than requiring huge leaps of faith or logic.A couple of caveats: First, those not familiar with the Star Wars universe or sci-fi/space opera in general may get a little bogged down by the technical vocabulary in a couple of places.And lastly, if you're an Expanded Universe fan, reading Zahn's works will have you forever searching for another EU author who comes even close to fulfilling the vast potential of the Star Wars setting with the same panache.",5,"US"
2010-08-27,"Must-Read for Long-time Fans and Newcomers Alike","Zahn was one of the first authors to come up with his own Star Wars plot, back in 1991. He's so great that many Star Wars authors will give him a nod in their ""Acknowledgements"" section. He deserves it.This trilogy is thrilling. If you don't know anything about Star Wars, this is a great place to get started - just watch the original 3 movies and you'll be all right. If you're a well-read Star Wars fan, you must read this book - Zahn created the characters of Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, and Talon Karrde - possibly three of the most interesting characters in the Star Wars cast.The plot is fascinating. Though it's been 5 years since the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of Darth Vader and the Emperor, the New Republic is suddenly put on the defensive when Thrawn gathers what's left of the Empire's resources to subtlety bring down the New Republic. While you have to root for the ""good guys"", you are forced to respect Thrawn because he is such a tactical genius.Zahn also does wonderfully in preserving the essence of all the movie characters - Threepio is still a priss, Han is still an incurably sardonic rogue, Lando is still a diehard businessman with a soft spot, and Luke and Leia are still... Luke and Leia. The writing is very good for this genre, and the books are perfectly paced.Zahn takes you all around the galaxy of Star Wars, showing you just how big it really is. You get to see Chewie's home world of Kashyyyk, meet a new alien race - the Noghri, and discover a lost fleet of two hundred Dreadnaughts. This trilogy reads quickly, is authentic, and has crazy twists. You won't know who to side with - the New Republic or the remnants of the Empire and its Dark Side weapon.",5,"US"

1998-11-12,"Read the Book","Let me begin by saying that most fans, perhaps not the loudest fans, but most fans of good Star Wars and good Sci-Fi will love this book. This being said, let me also say that in reading this book you should not expect any  logic, for recognize that it is in fact Star Wars, and thus the physics  make no sense. (Yes, I realize that this is not a good explanation, but it  is true.) This book, more so than any Star Wars book save maybe the X-Wing  books, continues in the style of the movies, with a diversity of characters  from smugglers to Imperial captains, and epic battles  against the Empire.  Thrawn truly captures the spirit of Star Wars better than any other.",5,"US"
2012-02-24,"Awesome Star Wars Read!","This book was referred to me by 2 people who are avid Star Wars fans. I have never read any of the books before and was told this one was a good ""starter"" book. They were NOT wrong at all! This book was definetly captivating, making you want more. I had visions of my head of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill in my head anytime one of them had a scene. I wish they would have touched more on the Princess Leia story line but I have a feeling that the next books are big for that. Most definetly can't wait to read the next two in this trilogy!",5,"US"
1999-07-10,"characters are very real and the plot unfolds dramatically","This is a wonderful addition to the legendary Star Wars trilogy. Mara Jade is without a doubt one of the best characters I've ever seen, and the whole thing with her, Luke, and the Emperor is great. I think one of the best  things that could ever happen to them is for Luke and Mara to fall in love  during a different trilogy. Karrde and Thrawn are completely alike, both  calm and calculating, even during defeat. C'boath definately reminds me of  Emperor Palpatine, and the fact that he's an insane clone just adds to the  creepiness factor.  If all the Star Wars books were written like this one,  we wouldn't have paper and words anymore. We'd have a new religion. (P.S. -  JEDI ROCK!!!!!",5,"US"
2000-10-13,"Zahn nails the Star Wars universe.","It is difficult to take existing characters and create new stories -- you always piss someone off (like the X-Files novels did for me). Mr. Zahn has an uncanny grasp of the Star Wars characters that took my breath away.This novel picks up 5 years after Return of the Jedi leaves off. Leia and Han are pregnant, Luke is teaching Leia about the force, and the New Republic is finding its legs after the defeat of the Emperor and Darth Vader. A cunning new Grand Admiral has taken over the reigns of the shattered Empire and is plotting against the New Republic. A military genius, he has a few tricks up his sleeve that might tip the balance in the continuing power struggle for the galaxy.

Tim Zahn knocked it out of the park and I have never looked back. I now collect the SW books but this holds true as the best. Awesome book that I reread frequently to join Luke, Han and Leia once again. Great piece of writing and I highly advise reading this. George Lucas wishes he'd thought of it first!",5,"US"
2002-11-10,"Yes!","I received this book when I was nine years old. At that time I had no interest in reading it even though I was a Star Wars fan. So there it sat for almost five years, until I picked it up and started reading. Now three years later, I own the entire Trilogy, in search of the Hand of Thrawn books and the New Jedi Order books.  Timothy Zahn stays so true to the theme and mood that you get of the Star Wars movies, that you feel that this is really what would happen to those characters.  The gang is back, and now up against a formidable foe, Grand Admiral Thrawn, the most worthy and feared adversary since ol' Darth Vader. The book starts out like very movie, in space and with the Empire. Han and Leia are married and twins are on the way. Luke is a Jedi Knight and with out the comfort of Ben Kenobi. The droids are back and lovable Chewbacca. Lando is still looking for a get rich quick scheme. New and likable characters are introduced. The mysterious Mara jade and charismatic Talon Karrde. Also the insane Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth.  The plotline is easy to follow and gives you a real Star Wars sense. If you like this book, don't stop, read Dark Force Rising and The Last Command.",5,"US"
2004-03-04,"A great start to a new trilogy","Star Wars: Heir to the Empire was written by Hugo award winning author Timothy Zahn.  Heir to the Empire is one of the many (maybe 100 novels and countless comic books) officially licensed books of the Star Wars universe.  As I understand it, the way these books are made is by an author pitching an idea to Lucasfilm Ltd, then if it gets approved the author writes the story, and then the story must be approved by George Lucas himself.  If all that happens the book will be printed, (and often times become number one national bestsellers). Heir to the Empire is the continuation of the story line after Return of the Jedi.  As I understand it one might consider this episode VII. The story picks up five years after Return of the Jedi, with Darth Vader and the Emperor dead along with the second Death Star destroyed.  After the Rebel Alliance defeated the heart of the Empire they became the New Republic.  However there are still remnants of the Imperial fleet scattered throughout the galaxy, and one new villain to lead them.  His name is Grand Admiral Thrawn.  He is one of the few alien species allowed into the ranks of the Empire (the Empire is notoriously racist against non-humans) and the only alien to have any rank of authority, let alone Grand Admiral which is the highest rank in the Imperial military.  He is basically human looking except for his pale blue skin and glowing red eyes, which probably symbolize his cold, calculating genius along with his burning evil lust for conquest.  He unites the remnants of the Imperial fleet and organizes them in his evil and genius plans to cripple and destroy the vulnerable New Republic while it's still in its infancy. Standing in his way (oh yes, there's always somebody standing in the villain's way) are Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2D2, C3PO, Wedge Antilles, Admiral Ackbar and the rest of the characters of the original Star Wars trilogy you (should) already know and love. And that, I believe, is largely what this book is counting on: its readers already being Star Wars fans with a decent working knowledge of Star Wars characters, technology, and even culture.  In my mind that is probably a pretty safe assumption but there is always the possibility of someone picking up and reading (or trying to read) this book without already having seen the Star Wars movies.  My recommendation of this book would admittedly be negatively and noticeably impacted if I was talking to someone who had never seen the movies.  Not a whole lot of wordage is used when describing things that Star Wars fans should already know, such as the physical appearance of Han Solo (one can just picture Harrison Ford and leave it at that) etc.  However new characters and environments are described in great detail.  That being said, most Americans have seen at least one Star Wars movie and at least know what a ""lightsaber"" or ""blaster"" (laser gun) looks like. Zahn's militaristic style of writing is evident through the pages of Heir to the Empire, as you can see by these reviews: ""Zahn (is) near the top on any list of military-science fiction or action-science fiction writers.  So it was a good idea to turn him loose on the universe and characters of `Star Wars'... good fun.""  ----- Chicago Sun-Times ""(Zahn's) descriptions of weapons and ships make him the Tom Clancy of a galaxy far, far away."" ------- Manhattan (Kansas) Mercury I think this style works very well for most of the book, and where it needs a bit more adventurous or magical spirit, Zahn is happy to oblige.  He gives the book a very suspenseful and exciting feel.Sometimes in the book there are some parts that seem oddly coincidental, such as Han Solo happening to unknowingly visit the planet and even the very encampment where Luke Skywalker was being held prisoner.  However the beauty (or idiocy, depending on the reader) of the Star Wars universe is that pretty much everything can be explained by means of the Force.  You may have heard the phrase ""the Lord works in mysterious ways.""  Well here it's the same concept but instead it's the Force works in mysterious ways.  The Force is an all-encompassing energy field that is produced by life itself.  It can use people and be used by people.  It can manifest itself in many forms, such as telekinesis, lighting, visions of the past and possible future, increased speed of movement, telepathy, and other such premonitions.  Therefore there is pretty much nothing that can happen in the Star Wars universe that cannot be explained by the Force.  To me the Force is a very ingenious idea for a fantasy story such as these.The end of this book leaves the reader very hungry for more (it ends in a small-scale space-naval skirmish), but when the author has written a whole new trilogy, that is pretty much the point.  All in all I think this is a worthy edition to the main Star Wars storyline, with a great combination of old and new characters.",4,"US"
1999-01-28,"The Best Sequels","I know George Lucas said a few weeks back he does not want to make Star Wars Episode VII-IX, but with the Hand of Thrawn Trilogy, he doesn't need  to.  These are the definitive sequels to the series.  The rest of the books  are just the same plots recyclyed over and over, again and again, but these  books are the ones that started the entire Star Wars book movement.  Grand  Admiral Thrawn is an awesome villan and the characters are very like how  they were in the films.  Much closue and conclusions are drawn here too,  since Return of the Jedi ended a little quickly in the minds of some.  All  out, this is an awesome book.",5,"US"
1999-10-12,"This is Star Wars.  The Force is with this book!","When I read this book, it felt just like the movies! Iloved how the author captured the the personality of all the characters.  You could tell  that while they are the same that they have also matured since return of the  Jedi.  The plot was great, and I love how the action was just like the  Star Wars movies.  Besides making a action filled book that goes into depth  of the characters feelings and personality, the author added new  ships,aliens, and characters while still  retaining the Star Wars spirit.  A great read for any reader, Star Wars or no Star Wars you will like this  book.  May the Force be with you.",5,"US"
1999-06-10,"THE BEST STAR WARS BOOK I HAVE READ SO FAR","This book is great!It is by far the best  I have read and Im expecting its sequels to Better!the plot is this;  Grand Admiral Thrawn is  the main bad guy here and finds  a dark jedi called C`baoth.c`baoth decides to join the  empire and in return get Leias Jedi children to weild as he wishes.But  first Leia must be captured. Meanwhile Someone called Talon Kardde is  taking over Jabba the hutt after his death, so Han and lando go to check  him out. Also,luke has had a jedi message sent to him by an unknown  character (at least to luke!) To put it honestly I think Tim zahn is the  best star wars book Author so far.",5,"US"
2003-03-17,"Good book","This was, if I recall, the first book (not including the God awful Dark Empire) in like 8 years written on Star Wars. Very well written, it takes place 5 years after Return of the Jedi and an alien Grand Admiral has taken over the Empire. The book is very well written and has a strong feel of the movies without a sense of stealing from the movies. The only thing I found to be somewhat pitiful was this new Dark Jedi clone who was hiding on one of the Emperor's private planets guarding some huge secret. While this sets up for the huge climatic duel in the final book, I felt to be somewhat of poor authorship.",5,"US"
2016-06-13,"Love the Star Wars ""Legends""!!!!!!!!!","I believe this was the first Star Wars book I ever bought. I can only say, Wow! Amazing! Stupendous! This book is just as good as movies 4-6. The characters are very believable and are the same as in the movies. The villains are in-depth and very ingenious. A must read for Star Wars fans! Timothy Zahn is the J.R.R Tolkien of the science fiction realm.",5,"US"
2007-05-16,"Heir to the Empire review by Llama King!!!!!","Heir to the Empire isa fast-paced Star Wars book by Timothy Zahn. It starts out with Grand Admiral Thrawn and Captain Pelleaon going to Mount Tantiss to uncover the Emperor's storehouse, a place rumored to have a cloaking device and some Spaarti cylinders. A cloaking device is a device that masks a ship from sensors, and, in the hands of the Imperial Remnant, it would prove devastating to the New Republic. But, the Grand Admiral and Pelleaon come across Joruus C'Baoth, the clone of Jorus C'Baoth, and a tale of action, adventure, sacrifice, a little blood spilt, and loyalty unfolds.",5,"US"
2006-09-17,"What Star Wars Could have Become","I hadn't bothered to read this series before, but since I've vowed not to give Lucas anymore of my viewing dollars, I decided to get a little Star Wars fix by reading these.They were quite good. Much better than I'd expected, actually. I'm not a person who normally enjoys franchise books - AD&D, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. But this was a real treat - it felt like a worthy successor to the original Star Wars trilogy.I wouldn't say run out, buy them, and camp out for a weekend. But, if you have room in your reading schedule, feel free - you won't feel cheated.",4,"US"
2015-03-01,"Awesome!!!","I thought this Star Wars book was awesome. There was so much action and great plot twists that kept me guessing and I really enjoyed the scenes bewteen Luke and Mara Jade.

The depth that is required and the antisipation is all there.The story ends all to quickly as you finish up the book and have 2 more books in the Thrawn Trilogy to look forward to reading and since they are already printed and reprinted many times over it is a great way to get back into Star Wars - minus dorky heros like Jar Jar Binks and read real villians like Thrawn that can be rooted for and despised at the same time and see if Luke has met his match.You will not be disapointed.",5,"US"

1998-08-23,"Zahn Rules!!","This book was TERRIFIC! It was the first Star Wars book I read and I  immediately loved it. After reading some of the other Star Wars books out  there, that opinion increased even more. To ""a reader from USA""'s  comment about sofisticated language: These are imperial commanders and  people extrodinaraly high up in whatever command structure they are  concerned with. What did you expect someone like Grand Admiral Thrawn to  say? Dude, I'm like totally with you and yeah, definately?! Anyway, this  was a wonderful book and anyone that hasn't read it yet really REALLY  should.",5,"US"
1998-08-01,"A great read!","To disspell some myths about this book: 1) If the sophisticated language is to much for you, well then that says something about you...2) Every Imperial officer did not die at Endor, Thrawn and Pellaeon to name a few.3) Thrawn did almost beat the Rebellion, thats why he was a Grand Admiral4) They can ""account"" for the other 12 Grand Admirals by simply checking the Coruscant central computer5) Cocking an eyebrow is giving someone a dirty look, or looking like you are in intense thought.6) Zahn is the best author of any of the Star Wars novels.",5,"US"
2013-03-06,"Heir to the Empire never really kicks off","""Heir to the Emprie,"" as most people already know, takes place five years after Episode VI. It continues the adventures of the four central characters of the original trilogy (or six, if you count the R2 and C3PO ... but they're relegated to little more than scenery in this novel). It also introduces the ever-popular antagonist Admiral Thrawn and Luke's dark Jedi counterpart Mara Jade.So far, so good right?Well, there's a problem, this novel never really seems to kick off. It's kind of hard to pinpoint exactly why that is, but it could do with Zahn spending his time thinking up hard-to-pronounce and hard-to-remember names for every other character in the book. You see, Zahn really loves apostrophes, especially if they fall in the middle of a word. He likes them so much that sometimes there's two or more in a single name.He apparently also liked the Clone Arc from the Spider-Man comics, because we have a very Marvel-esque villain in Jorus C'Boath (or is that Jorrus C'Boath, I can't eff'n remember). C'Boath is a clone of an ancient Jedi master and has all sorts of super powers, all of which are rendered useless when in the presence of a furry lizard. If that's not enough, he apparently clones Luke in one of the other novels of this series and there's a big fight or something. C'Boath really wants Luke for some reason ... or maybe his sister. I guess he wants them to be his apprentices and turn them to the Dark Side. But it's never really fully explained why it has to be them, considering the Force was to be in everything I thought.Anyway, there's a couple of laser fights, some planet jumping and characters being held prisoner ... not really stuff we haven't seen before in a Star Wars story. That's not exactly a crime, but you're not really given any new revelations about the characters or the Star Wars Universe. It also seems a much of it is there just to fill up a couple of hundred pages to ensure this book is part of a trilogy. That probably means that we'll have more of the same in the second book.This padding of the book leaves me feeling as if we're waiting for the actual story to start, and you're left with that feeling when you get to the end of the book. As a reader, that's kind of leaves me feeling like I spent a lot of time with a free sample and now have to buy the actual product.Now, it's possible that I might read the sequel novels ... but I really have no desire to. They're available at any time at my local library, but the desire just hasn't been there. This is more than a year after reading ""Heir to the Empire,"" which doesn't bode well for the book as far as I'm concerned.",2,"US"
2005-05-02,"SW: The Next Generation (not a good thing!)","This talky and not very dynamic SW novel is very much to SW what ""The Next Generation"" was to the Trek franchise.  It hits all the core ideas of the franchise, but doesn't really expand on them, making sure it goes exactly where we've gone before.""Heir"" picks up the SW saga 5 years after the Rebellion's triumph at Endor. By ""now"" the dread imperial star fleet has been reduced to shreds commanded by a loose array of brooding admirals and imperial generals who, for the reverence they exact from their troops, are little more than potentates of discord. The rebellion, now a new republic, contends not only with the remnants of the empire but the anarchy left by its collapse. (Remember, the Empire didn't rely on unity to enhance its rule - preferring to split the galaxy into military districts and using firepower to subdue everybody else.) While the new republic tries to create order, Luke leaves on a search for a lost jedi knight. Han and Leia are separated as Leia finds herself pursued by mysterious bounty hunters. Lando Calrissian finds the maneuverings of the imperial fleet getting in the way of one his latest schemes. Meanwhile, Admiral Thrawn, late of the Imperial fleet, maneuvers his ragtag collection of worn-out star destroyers in harassing raids against the fringes of the republic. Though he's fighting a losing battle, he has other plans, all centered around a lost jedi. Is this the beginning of a new saga?As if.In every way, this over-sized potboiler saps the saga everything that made it fun. While the original scripts relied on techno-babble as a necessary evil - Zahn uses it as main dialog. Worse, unlike each of the films, which were necessarily connected but also complete by themselves, ""Heir"" is obviously the incomplete episode of a larger series. That Zahn couldn't write a singular plot (whether to be connected to sequels or not) says less about the complexity of the story than Zahn's derivative, meandering plot. Thrawn (who appears in the PC game ""Tie Fighter"" of 1994) plans some moves, but keeps strategy to himself; Luke searches for some last Jedi, but the implications are pretty vague; A mysterious and sinister Jedi may be a clone of another mysterious and dark jedi; Lando has his business pursuits; and so on. Instead of bringing these threads together, Zahn adds more, and never seems to know where he's going. Instead of climaxes that tie the disparate threads together (as in the movies) we have orbiting story arcs that merge together. It's almost as if the points of the plot had nothing better to do than prolong the book and ensure sequels.  Narrative aside, Zahn's plot doesn't quite stand the test of time, and its unoriginal plot ideas (clones, dark jedis, interplanetary gangsters who play both sides and the ever-present threat that the empire will resurrect itself) wasn't quite the epic when it first appeared. Nothing here communicates the drama, irony or velocity of the movies, and some ideas like plants that feed on force power, seem more like contrived ideas created for a video game than substantive plot elements (Lucas took a big hit for suggesting ""Midi Chloridians"", yet the idea of ""force-sucking"" ferns seems about as palatable). Without the kinetic style of the movies, ""Heir"" is like ""Phantom Menace"" without the special effects.",2,"US"
2006-03-06,"A Worthy Opponent in Thrawn","ACK!! I meant to give it 5 Stars.  and now I can't change it.Vader is dead, The Emperor is dead, who else is there to cause disruption in the galaxy??  Admiral Thrawn.Yes, this book is great.  It's the characters we love, the spaceships we thought were cool, and the jedi action we demand.  But there is something else about this book that makes it stand out so much.  The bad guys are, well, pretty darn awesome.  The Empire has had a facelift.  No longer are they petty fumbling stormtroopers, but rather competant warriors and leaders fighting to regain a foothold in the galaxy, and they are led by Thrawn, who is a military genius.This first book is of course just the set up for the other two books, but it is a great read.  All the new characters are worthy additions to the Star Wars universe and the EU probably wouldn't exist without this capable first part of the three book cycle.",3,"US"
2012-09-15,"The reason Star Wars is what it is today","If it wasnt for Timothy Zahn there wouldnt have been the 100+ books (nearly all of them inferior to this and the two other books in the series) that currently clutter the book shelfs. I was eleven when this came out and besides Splinter of the Mind Eye and 3 books each on Han Solo and Lando Calrissian there was very little else to suggest Star Wars would become a franchise to challenge and eventually over take Star Trek as the dominant science fiction franchise.  This changed all that and made way for the expanded universe and YES probably made the prequels possible.  I find myself wishing Lucas had filmed these instead of the stories that he did while I guess some enjoyed the Prequels I only found the last one to be enertainment that I wanted to rewatch. This book has the best two expanded universe characters Thrawn (still have his action figure on a bookshelf) and Mara Jade.  A tactical genius that runs the new republic in circles Thrawn is just said to be a brilliant tactician Zahn explains each move and why he does it most of the time against Pellaeons objections till he calmly explains his reasoning also Thrawn doesnt need a super duper world destroying weapon to win battles.  Mara is a tough troubled but determined lieutenant in a the reigning crime king pins organization who was once the emperors henchwoman and will become become much more in the future but this was her start.  Being a military sci fic fan into my adult years I continue to pick up every Zahn novel as it comes out.  He continues to serve up a superior Star Wars read every few years and fans of these should check out his other projects most notably the Icaurus Hunt and the Cobra series.  I have read this trilogy several times over the years and was overjoyed to see something like this announced.  I love commentaries and behind the scenes documentary on movies so seeing this on my favorite Star Wars trilogy was a real pleasure.  I would definitley buy Dark Force rising and the Last Command in Anniversary editions if they were done up with the notations by the author and others and the short story added at the end. However I have not heard any good news on this Star Wars fans need to dish out for this trust me if you are a fan of the original trilogy you will not be dissapointed heres hoping Del Rey will put out the rest of the Thrawn trilogy in special editions.",5,"US"

This was the first one I picked up even though there are more before this exiting edition to the trilogy. To be exact there are 6 (six)!

Seeing Luke use the force in the  movies was one thing, but being inside his head while he does it, quite  another. This novel adds whole layers of complexity to the characters we  know and love, making their movie versions look more like cartoon heroes  than people.

2003-05-24,"Zahn is the Elvis of the SW novelists!!!","As one critic once said ""Zahn has perfectly captured the pace and flavor of the SW films. This is space opera at it's best."" HE'S RIGHT INDEED 100,000%!!! Zahn's Thrawn trilogy is even better than the original SW films themselves in terms of it's action scenes and it's character development and it introduces new worlds like Coruscant,Nkllon,Wayland and we see Chewie's home world of Kashyyykup close and personal,we see new ships like the Skipray Blastboat and the Inderdictor Cruiser and new intriguing characters like the blue-skinned Chiss Grand Admiral Thrawn,the mad Jedi clone Joruus C'Boath,the smuggler Talon Karrde and the beautiful former Emporer's Hand Mara Jade(I have a thing for Mara). There is a beautiful scene where Luke says farewell to spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi forever and confirms to Luke that he is not the last of the old Jedi but the first of the new.We have a very cool space battle in Heir to the Empire at the Sluis Van Shipyards,a space battle for the mysterious Katana Fleet of Dreadnaughts in Dark Force Rising and a final space battle at the Bilbringi shipyards in The Last Command and we have a final lightsaber duel between our hero Luke Skywalker and his clone Luuke Skywalker who has his original lightsaber that belonged to his father Anakin but lost it and his hand in a duel with his father Darth Vader a.k.a. Anakin Skywalker. Luke and Mara battle the insane Jedi Joruus C'Boath in a final duel at Emporer's storehouse in Mount Tantiss on Wayland. And of course we have our favorite starship the MILLENNIUM FALCON flying all over the galaxy and jumping to hyperspace in the trilogy.Zahn gives perfect descriptions of ships jumping to hyperspace(the stars flared into starlines and became the mottled sky of hyperspace)deep space,alien worlds and space battles. ZAHN IS THE ELVIS PRESLEY OF THE STAR WARS NOVELISTS!!I was waiting with anticpation for Zahn's next SW novel The Hand of Thrawn which became 2 SW books Specter of the Past and Vision of the Future and was not disapointed for it revealed Thrawn's species the Chiss and his background and opened up a vast new area of the galaxy:THE UNKNOWN REGIONS and had the last remnants of the Empire make peace with the New Republic.And good news for us Zahn fans:He is writing two more SW novels one called SURVIVOR'S QUEST due out February 3,2004 and will deal with Luke Skywalker and his new bride Mara Jade-Skywalker venturing into the Unknown Regions examining the wreckage of the long lost Outbound Flight Project ship while his second book will be a prequel-era novel dealing with the Outbound Flight Project itself and it's destruction by a young Thrawn out in Chiss Space(Unknown Regions) and is currently due November 1,2005(after the release of Episode III). The Outbound Flight Project was an event that was mentioned in Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy and it had the orginal Jedi Master Jorus C'Boath and five other Jedi Masters heading out to another galaxy to find new life and find other force sensetive species but failed due to it's destruction by Thrawn. Fans have been waiting for years to see this story told and will be expanded upon in Zahn's upcoming books.",5,"US"

A wonderful place to start the Expanded Universe readings, although, some people might find it helpful to read the series' leading up to this one(the X-Wing series and the Courtship of Princess  Leia) to fill in the gaps such as Leia being pregnant, etc. The one problem  I had with this book was the ysalamiri. A creature able to push back the  Force, just so Luke can be put in an impossible situation without his  powers. Other than that it was great. I was on the edge of my seat, and  couldn't put it down.

Five years later i began reading it again this time able to soak it all up and my god i could not put it down.Timothy zahn is a great author going into such detail that it just sucks you right in after finishing the trilogy i began catching myself finding areas where it could be filmed at and so on.This book is the greatest of all the trillogies, it truley captures the world of star wars and is written unbelivebly well. i have yet to even find a contender with this trillogy.The reading level is teen and up and is completly adicting i highly recomend it.",5,"US"
2003-11-09,"Zahn's Original Masterpiece","Reading had always been an activity I enjoyed in my free time, and although I occasionally read a Star Wars book, I was never left with the feeling that the films had given me.  Most that I read would have entertaining stories, but despite the plot I would find myself struggling to read them to the end; they simply couldn't hold my attention.  That all changed when I read Heir to the Empire, the first book in a three part series written by Timothy Zahn.  Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, The Last Command, and the two follow-ups that Zahn later wrote, stand apart from all other Star Wars books and most other books in general.  Zahn's work is absolutely stunning; with Heir to the Empire he took Star Wars to an entirely new level.  The story and characters are superb; the writing itself is magnificent.  Timothy Zahn truly captured the epic scope and feeling of the Star Wars universe and then expanded it far beyond.  Unlike the film trilogy, Zahn put an emphasis on the strategy and politics of war rather than simply showing the battles as a series of flashy, but entertaining, random explosions.  The tactics and stratagems he devised for use in the series are explained well enough to seem perfectly believable, while at the same time being just fantastic and crazy enough to fit excellently into the unique universe that George Lucas created.  The characters that Zahn devised for his stories are memorable and unique; they compliment the standard Star Wars cast wonderfully.  Many of the more interesting characters are members of the Empire, still fighting a battle against the Rebel Alliance, now known as the New Republic, even though they are currently losing badly.  The many Imperial characters that Zahn made, and the focus he put on the Empire, was something that hadn't been done before in Star Wars.  During the films you only had glimpses of how the Empire worked, with only Vader and Palpatine as actual characters.  For his books Zahn made many Imperial officers main characters to give the reader insight on how the enemies of the Rebellion viewed the universe, and the war they'd been in for so long.  The most notable of these villains is, of course, Grand Admiral Thrawn, who has assumed leadership over the remnants of the Empire.  As the primary antagonist, Thrawn is a welcome change from the cryptic, detached villains from the films.  There is rarely a single event in Heir to the Empire that was not carefully planned by Thrawn himself.  Even the cast of heroes eventually take note that nothing they see can be accepted as truth with some one of Thrawn's manipulative and tactical genius plotting against them.  Everything they witnessed could be part of his plan, causing them to question anything that happened; only then wandering if that's exactly what Thrawn wanted them to question while he did something completely different.  Attempting to unravel the dozens of layers to Thrawn's plans along with the heroes was one of the many things that kept me reading no matter how many other things I needed to do at the time.  Then there were equally impressive new protagonists, my favorite being Mara Jade, who has since appeared in dozens of additional Star Wars novels.  Similar to Han Solo, Jade is initially a hero by circumstance and not by choice.  As a former servant of the Emperor, Jade is engaged in an internal battle.  She doesn't want to work for the Empire, realizing that it is no longer what Emperor Palpatine had envisioned.  On the other hand, she doesn't want to aide the New Republic as they are the cause of the Empires fall.  In fact, she adamantly hates Luke Skywalker, the hero of the New Republic, and desires nothing more than to see him dead.  Zahn constantly puts Mara Jade into positions where she must choose to side with Thrawn, or side with Luke Skywalker, which to her is like choosing between two evils.  The constant tension, unexpected turns, incredible new characters and classic faces that are now more mature, bring Heir to the Empire to life.  Not once did I feel disappointed, and not once did I find anything that I disliked; the book was absolutely perfect.  Timothy Zahn is truly an outstanding writer for being able to create books every bit as enchanting and spectacular as the film trilogy itself.  Every Star Wars fan owes it to themselves to read Zahn's five books.  Make sure to take time off from work first, though; it may be difficult to put the books down.",5,"US"
2013-12-04,"Zahn is amazing!","All the characters from the original movies, foreshadowing of a future marriage, and a brilliant and unique antagonist all beautifully interwoven into a fabulous plot.

I have yet to run across a better constructed group of books.",5,"US"
2000-05-11,"A must read for everything calling itself a Star Wars fan.","5 stars, easy!  This novel, and it's two sequels, where the first of the new Star Wars novels and it looks a lot like they publishced the best first.The novel has exactly the same feeling and atmosphere as the  original trilogy, and expands briliantly on it. The classic Star Wars  characters are portraited as they were in the movies, and the new ones look  and feel like they were created by George Lucas himself. The story was  superb and filled with plots and subplots but never got confusing or  overcomplicated.The only critism I have was the fact that a certain  character named Joruus C'baot was included in the story. He was a very  irritating character and kept me constantly hoping that Thrawn would have  him being fed to his pet Noghri. Fortunatly, Joruus wasn't irritating  enough by far to destroy the novel. The great characters of Grand Admiral  Thrawn (best Star Wars villain ever! ) and Mara Jade (good-bye Callista)  made more than up for him.Last critism: Thrawn's schemes and vile  plotting usally only failed becouse the heroes where simply lucky enough to  notice them in the nick of time.In short: one of the best SW series  ever, even better than the X-wing series bij Arron and Stackpole.",5,"US"
2011-11-16,"They should do this for more books!","This book was one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I have ever had. I had never read Heir to the Empire before and so when I saw this book I had to pick it up and read it since I had heard how good it is. Not only is the story excellent, the annotations and introduction are great because is reveals the author's thoughts and motivations behind the different parts of the story. It's like watching a movie with commentary, except it's better because you can ""pause"" the book (stop reading the story), read the behind-the-scenes look, then go back to where you left off. I saw another review by a first timer that didn't like this, but I loved it. I think it added to the experience. Also, the novella included is also a pretty good story. I would love more Star Wars books to do this, and it seems perfect for such a pivotal novel in the history of the EU. Every Star Wars fan should read this book!",5,"US"
2003-03-05,"This book...... is off the hook!!","This is without a doubt the best Star Wars book ever written.  All other Zahn books are a close second of course, but this is the Mona Lisa.  If you haven't read this book, go buy it now!  If you are still reading this review, that means you are not on your way to the bookstore, and that is actually a good thing.  Because now I can remind you to purchase two copies of this book because you will wear the first one out!  When the characters speak you can actually hear their voices as if you were watching a movie.  Zahn is the only author capable of doing that for me.  When Han talks, I hear Harrison Ford's voice, and I LOVE that.  Actually, Stackpole can pull it off sometimes, but not always.  I do not want to tell anyone what this book is about, you need to find that out for yourself.  But trust me, this book is a perfect ten!  Go buy it NOW!",5,"US"
1999-07-06,"A fine continuation of the Star Wars saga","What enticed me to read Heir to the Empire were Usenet posters' comments that its antagonist, Grand Admiral Thrawn, is an example of a competent Evil Overlord. In this respect, Zahn delivers. Thrawn is at least as  menacing as Vader, replacing Jedi powers with sheer cunning. As such, the  largest problem I had with this novel is the amount of good fortune the  good guys needed to escape Thrawn's clutches again and again.Mara Jade,  another original character, also has much promise. I only hope Zahn  develops Mara and Thrawn more in the second two books.",4,"US"

My point is that I'm usually pretty good at stopping myself and going and doing things that need to be done (like have an actual life) but with this book that went all out the window. It is amazing and I can't sing its praises enough. One of the funniest things is I always told myself there was no need reading all the novels, the films started and finished the story and that was that. But I was drawn to this by the 5 star rating. What book that has been along for about 10 years on amazon still have a nearly uninterrupted 5 star rating? I'll tell you, it's this one and with good reason.

2003-09-19,"Heir to the Empire worthy first literary Star Wars sequel","In 1991, Bantam Books and Lucasfilm Ltd. reinvigorated interest in the Star Wars universe (well, galaxy) by gathering a diverse group of noted science fiction writers and starting a regular series of novels set in the time period which follows Return of the Jedi.Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire, the first volume of a three-book cycle, was almost an instant phenomenon when it was published in hardcover. With its depiction of the continuing battle between what is left of the Galactic Empire and the fledgling New Republic, this novel cleverly mixes the characters from the Classic Trilogy with a cast of newly created heroes and villains, some of whom will make appearances in other authors' Star Wars works.As Heir to the Empire begins, the New Republic has been engaged in a long campaign to mop up the remnants of the once-mighty Empire.  The once dreaded Imperial Fleet is in disarray, political and military control of the late Emperor Palpatine's New Order has changed hands several times, yet the former Rebels have reduced Imperial dominion to one quarter of its former size. Yet even as Mon Mothma and the New Republic government establish democratic rule from Coruscant (former capital of both the Old Republic and the Galactic Empire), a new dark force has arisen in the form of one of the Empire's most cunning warriors.His name is Thrawn, and his tactical and intellectual gifts are so great that the racist and sexist Palpatine had promoted him to be the only non-human to wear the white uniform of Grand Admiral.  For several years after the Battle of Endor (where the Rebels destroyed the second Death Star and both the Emperor and Darth Vader died), Thrawn was pacifying the Unknown Regions until his return to Imperial territory.  Now, with a small but powerful Imperial fleet at his command, the mysterious Grand Admiral believes he holds the key to the undoing of the New Republic and the restoration of the Empire.Zahn not only introduced a set of new characters that would become essential to what fans know as the Expanded Universe series (the charming smuggler-chief Talon Karrde, the beautiful but mysterious Mara Jade, the devoted Imperial fleet captain Pelleaon, and the mad clone Joruus C'baoth), but he brought fans of the movie heroes up to date on the lives of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa Solo, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, and the droids.A professional reviewer, at the time of the book's first appearance in 1991, wrote that Heir to the Empire ""captures the spirit of the movie trilogy so well, you can almost hear John Williams' soundtrack.""  Indeed, Zahn does a superb job rendering the personalities from George Lucas' films that one can almost hear Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams, and Anthony Daniels when reading their characters' dialogue.  The pace of the book is brisk and the action sequences are so well done that one can swear they are cinematic.  Although there are many Star Wars authors whose novels are spellbinding, Zahn stands head and shoulders above the crowd.",5,"US"
2014-05-22,"All fears relieved","A long time Star Wars fan, I had never read any of the books for fear of them being tacky and not true to the feel of the movies. I have never been a fan of books written from movies, either, so I had doubt. But, after reading this first Star Wars book, I am sold... at least on Tim Zahn's ability to recreate that galaxy far, far away! I'm sure I will now enjoy many more of the books. This 20th anniversary edition is especially cool as it includes notes from Tim and others about the writing of this book and surrounding action that really add to the excitement of it all and give a depth to the reader that allows you to really feel a part of the history of Star Wars.",5,"US"
2007-06-13,"Readable but annoyingly written continuation of original trilogy","My curiosity finally got the better of me, so I decided I would read the official continuation of the Star Wars story post Return of the Jedi. It starts out familiarizing the reader with a glossing over of the post Death Star V2 Emperor defeat happenings and jumps right into the activities of the new self appointed head of the Imperial forces, Admiral Thrawn who has been successfully raiding New Republic bases and supply lines. He has a plan to reinsert the Empire into their previous spot as bully overlord of the galaxy and Heir to the Empire is the jumping off point for this story, which takes three books to wrap up.First off, it's an easy read. The story flows at a pretty good pace and seems to match the films in this respect. There are plenty of new characters that are realized relatively well and only seem out of place sometimes by name more than anything else. Some of the names of the characters just don't seem appropriate for Star Wars and it can be a little distracting, but not terribly so. What is more distracting however, and what makes these books less successful for me, is the lazy writing of the author. He can only describe moods with lip characterizations and most of the time, it's of the ""so and so's lip twisted"" variety, like...Han is mad: His lip twistsLuke is worried: His lip twistsLeia is frightened: Her lip twistsLuke is determined: His lip twistsC3PO is acting dandy: His... Just kidding (Zahn probably had to hold himself back none the less)He also comes up with new ideas of how to describe things and just starts using them all of a sudden but doesn't go back to insert them into earlier parts of the book. It's just weird when a character starts using a phrase all of a sudden, frequently, and they never used it for the first half of the book. How hard would it be to go back and place it in earlier parts of the book to make the character's use of language consistent?And don't get me started on the Mynocks! ""The thingy took off like a Mynock with a scorched tail."" ""It fell to the ground like a clipped Mynock."" ""He chortled like a bemused Mynock."" ""She ate like an anorexic Mynock.""... and on and on.Additionally,these characters, and maybe this was unavoidable but I don't think so, live completely in the past that is the 3 prequels. They are not given much of a life before them, in memory, so all of their recall harks back to the films (like we need to be reminded what happened) and that gets old real quick. Everything is ""this is just like it happened on the Death Star"" or ""don't you remember what he did at Mos Eisley?"" or ""Luke thought back to the cave on Daigobah."" Where's that extra mystery of the stuff we didn't see? It's like sitting around a bunch of people who only reminisce about a small period in their lives... Enough!Well, I guess I'm trying to say that Heir to the Empire is not very well written, but the story is relatively interesting, easy to read, and, well, it tells us what happens to Luke and all of the rest after Return of the Jedi. I imagine a lot of people don't expect to find something literate in a book like this, but, maybe just once, I would like to be surprised.",3,"US"

1999-03-30,"Whoa!!! Could there be a better book or author","This has got to be one of the best books ever.  It has an excellent start which grips the reader like n other book, The ending whilst not so cliff-hanging to be annoying makes you want to read the next book in the  series.  Timothy Zahn has got to be the most inciteful, intelligent S.W.  author there is,  I definitely recomend this book and every othere book he  has written, i think i've read them all.  How he can make the Grand  Admirall appear so clever is beyond me.  All of his leaps can be justified  as well.",5,"US"
1999-02-27,"Great start to the post-ROTJ novels...","Zahn's treatment of the main characters doesn't agree 100% with the movies, except that when extrapolated from the time of the Battle of Endor, the characterizations make sense.  Luke seems more cerebral, as a  last-of-his-kind Jedi would likely be.  Han and Leia are similarly  extrapolated, although I'm not as fond of Han.  The story is kind of slow  at times and Thrawn's ability to determine strategies based on race seems  far-fetched.  However, looking past that, this is a very good start to the  afterlife for the SW universe.",4,"US"
2012-09-06,"So--Ahab, Nemo, Wolf Larsen, and now Thrawn.","(This is really a review of the trilogy. But since we need to begin any trilogy with the first book, here I go ...)So--Ahab, Nemo, Wolf Larsen, and now Thrawn. Who is the better death-admiral?Thrawn, like Nemo, has the benefit of civilization, something that Wolf Larsen lacks. Nemo and Larsen are inventive geniuses (with Wolf being an autodidact to boot), whereas Trawn is a tactical genius.For me, Thrawn has the best of both Nemo and Wolf Larsen, without Ahab's monomania and atavistic Satanism (""Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!"").In reality Thrawn reminds us of Rommel: apolitical, non-doctrinaire, a super-competent general, and not a Sith Lord. And this may be Zahn's voice of warning. Thrawn has admirable qualities--leadership, talent, great post-disaster debriefings (which nurture leadership), and organizational skills. True. But these good qualities do not cancel out the fact that he sided with the Empire, and endorses their approach. As Peter Kreeft observes, ""Even a murderer's bullet must be a good shot"" (A Summa of the Summa 415), and yet despite his excellent marksmanship, a murderer is still a murderer.Well, what does this have to do with the series? Simple: Zahn manages to create this villain who is both ""larger than life"" and ""lifelike"" to boot. He is a formidable foe to the now Skywalker clan. He not only keeps the tradition alive, he expands upon the mythos in an incredible way.",5,"US"
2011-12-06,"Star Wars without the Good Parts","I came into Heir to the Empire expecting a piece of speculative fiction on par with other stars of the genre like Dune, The Lord of the Rings, and the Dresden Files.That is not why I got at all.Instead, what I got was a plot which moves at a snail's pace between dull events, descriptions which consistently feel lifeless, characterization that is a poor imitation of that which the movies provide, characters and details in numbers that  bog down the story, and technique and style which are sorely lacking. The only aspect of this story keeping it from a one-star review is Grand Admiral Thrawn, the main antagonist, with his fascinating approach to warfare, planning, and investigation.In the end, I'm puzzled as to why this book is considered a classic. It's something I would not recommend to anyone, fan of Star Wars or otherwise.",2,"US"
2000-07-02,"Zahn does a pretty good job of writing for star wars","As I said, Timothy Zahn does a pretty good job writing for starwars.  I think Mara Jade's an idiot, however Luke Skywalker's evenworse (they make such a cute couple).  Captain Pellian was pretty irresponsible for a star destroyer captain.  All he did was hover around Thrawn and act stupid when there were battles.  Thrawn was allways talking about some elaborate scheme and Pellian was allways standing around saying ""huh?"" That's another thing, I don't think you can tell everything about a civilization's war tactics by studying its art.  Other than that, it was pretty good.",4,"US"
1998-07-08,"Zhan carries on the legacies Lucas began...","Zhan, unlike a good number of the newer writers for the Star Wars series, knows what he's doing.  In comparing this book and Zhan's rendering of the characters, to the over forty other Star Wars novels I've read, I have to say Heir to the Empire to by far one of THE best books in a glorious series of books, worthy of a sixth star. It is well written, well thought out, and the characters are true to themselves, a quality of writing many authors lack, including many of the other Star Wars authors.",5,"US"
1999-12-12,"A good Star Wars yarn","I read this book quite awhile ago, but have only got around now to reviewing it. Looking at what other people have said, I don't understand what some people have a problem with. Besides being the first attempt at a  Star Wars book, it had to try and live up to the movie legacy, and I think  Mr. Zahn did an extremely good job at that.  This was a very good book, I  thought. Grand Admiral Thrawn is the tactical genius now commanding the  Empire. We're kept guessing about Thrawn's background and such, but this is  suspenseful in it's nature. Anyway, he has the ability to pull a military  victory out of thin air in almost any situation. It seems to me that he has  the right resources and talent to do this. And you can learn much from  examining things made by other cultures. IE, the Ancient Egyptians,  Babylonians, etc. Many famous battles have been won by anylizing the past  history of the people you are fighting. And this book obviously lived up to  Lucas' expectations, he hasn't complained about it or anything. Besides,  this is the Star Wars universe. Made up, anything can happen. Without going  through the books, we wouldn't know what happened after Endor. For all we  know, the rest of the Imperial Fleet could have counterattacked the Rebel  Alliance at Endor and killed them (West End Games' Star Wars RPG Manuals,  which were LucasArts approved, state there are some 25,000 Star Destroyers  in service, this is quite possible). I think Mr. Zahn did an excellent job.",5,"US"
2013-12-06,"New Horizons","Known as the novel that launched the EU as we know it today, HEIR is a great follow up to the films. We're reintroduced not only to Luke, Han, & Leia, but also Chewbacca, Wedge, Lando, and others. From the struggle between the fledgling New Republic and the still powerful remnants of the Empire to the mysterious return of a Jedi Master long thought dead to a woman with a vendetta against the last of the Jedi, HEIR delivers a solid story. Still a great book after 20 years, despite the timeline issues with the Clone Wars.",5,"US"
2000-08-18,"Zahn is my favorite author","Even though I read this book long ago, I have since bought the  audicassetes and listen to routinely, along with my collection of other  Star Wars tapes. This series have everything. I really liked the Star Wars  movies when I first saw them, but you can't truly cal yourself a Star Wars  fan if you haven't read them. This is part of the continuing Star Wars  story that is made possible through the books. The story of a Grand Admiral  coming to take over the Empire, Leia going to Kashyke etc. is thrilling.",5,"US"
2000-07-02,"Star Clause?","I was very cynical when I came to this book, I mean nothing could recapture Star Wars, could it? But Zahn has done a very good job, the characters remain faithfull to the original, but reveals perfectly how they  react under new strains placed upon them. Like Luke doubting his teaching  og Leigh, or Han finding it hard to adjust to not being a rogue anymore. In  the light of Episode 1 some things don't ring true, like ""always two  there are, no more, no less"" seems dodgy when there's a Dark Jedi. But  hey this is just nit-picking, if you're a doubter than try this, you will  be impressed.",4,"US"
1999-08-09,"DISAPPOINTING!  DOES NOT LIVE TO THE TRILOGY!","I appreciated the book because of the familiar characters, but that was not enough to cover up for all the other shortcomings.  The characters seemed to have lost their aura.  Even Han Solo seemed to be uptight &  not as funny as he used to be.  The author tried to cover so many  territories that a lot of loopholes were left open.  For instace, he either  forgot or deliberately did not include what happened to C'Baoth after being  brought to Jomark. He dwelt about the cloned Jedi master but dwindled  afterwards. What about the Noghris?  Will they side finally with Leia?  What about Mara?  Has the narrow escape made her change her mind against  her plot against Luke?  I think, he should have covered all this & saw  it to the end, isntead of making the story long but hanging.",3,"US"
1999-04-05,"Tim Zahn is a genius.","My book collection started with Kevin Anderson's Jedi Academy, but this trilogy is way better. I've read the whole trilogy four or five times, and never get bored of it. My collection has topped 40 books and this is still  some of the best reading I have. Tim Zahn's portrayal of the characters  here are superb. Grand Admiral Thrawn is an excellent example.I commend  you, Mr. Zahn, and most of all, George Lucas who started it all. May the  Force be with every one of you.",5,"US"
1999-05-29,"Generally weak, overrated.","Compared to some of the other Star Wars books out there (Children of the Jedi, The Courtship of Princess Leia,) Heir to the Empire (and the other two books of this series) are pretty good.  However, I find this book to be  rather overrated by most people.  For one, the characters that Zahn  introduces are not all that interesting.  The story's main villian (Grand  Admirial Thrawn) is a cool-headed genius who plots and schemes and rarely  makes a mistake, however we are given no real insight into who Thrawn is.  The smuggler boss, Talon Karrde, is similar to Thrawn in that he is also  cool-headed and smart, and basically emotionless.  The worst thing about  this book is undoubtably the dialog.  As has been noted by other reviewers,  Zahn REPEATEDLY uses the same expressions and phrases for all his  characters, under almost all circumstances.  It makes all the dialog sound  the same and sound very uninteresting.  Everybody always doing ""wry  grins"" and saying things wryly and ""squeezing their thumb and  forefinger together"" (whatever that is,) and saying ""Point,""  ""Agreed,"" talking in cool, carefully modulated voices.  It's  stupid and it got on my nerves.  While the overall plot was okay, the  weak characters and dialog really spoil the series.  At times, it's like  you want to know what happens next, getting to the next part is sometimes  painful because of the poor dialog, and somewhat lacking descriptions.  And it really doesn't feel like Star Wars too me.  There is more wallowing  in grey areas than good vs. evil stuff, there is little drama and no color,  and no cool special effects.  A lot of people recommend this as the  first Star Wars book you should read, but I personally don't.  I think the  X-Wing Series is probably the best series out right now.  Although it  doesn't star any of the main characters of the movies, that is part of  what's so great about it... all the characters are new and fresh and are  developed from scratch.",2,"US"

And what a formidable foe Grand Admiral Thrawn is, a cunning tactician and leader. Even years after this novel was published lots of fans are eager to see this character on film.Leia expecting twins fathered by Han, twins that represent the next generation of Jedi.We are also introduced to Mara Jade as another important character for the Expanded Universe.I will not go into plot details for those that haven't read this book, but it is definitely essential reading in the Saga.

I think Luke is growing up, and is treating life much more cautiously, but I wish they would can that stuff. Where did the Luke we know from the movies go? This  is Luke in some ways, he's the same person when he's not in battle, but  when the battles come up, it's like whoosh, where'd the real Luke go?

With Emperor Palpatine having been killed in ROTJ, the Empire's remaining forces are without purpose. A new leader is needed, and met.

2004-04-05,"A Great Start to a Great Trilogy","Writer Timothy Zahn brings his considerable talents to the Star Wars universe with this book and the two that follow it.  I have read other non-Star Wars Zahn novels, including The Icarus Hunt and Cascade Point, and I believe he is at the top of his game in this exciting, character-driven story.  In Heir to the Empire, Zahn has brought us one of the greatest villains in the Star Wars saga and, in my opinion, all of science fiction, and that is Grand Admiral Thrawn.  This brilliant, cool, calculating, and unbelievably cruel fleet commander is second only to Darth Vader in my book of Star Wars baddies, and the series is worth reading for his presence alone.  The plot is thick and very involving, and the author succeeds at keeping the reader on his toes at all times.  The old Star Wars characters are back and as good as ever, and plenty of new characters make the galaxy that much more interesting.  It's a shame this book and the other two aren't made into movies, for they could rival the original trilogy in story quality and entertainment.  For anyone who is as big a Star Wars fan as I, this trilogy is definite must-buy.",5,"US"
2004-04-28,"Darn Good Adventure Book!","I would have given the book 5/5 stars, but the author used the word ""sardonically"" so many times it drove me batty. I hope nobody ever says that word to me again because I might go nutz on the spot and embarrass myself.  Oh and the other thing Timothy Zahn did that made me pull my hair out was that he was constantly measuring time in ""heartbeats"" of certain characters in the book.  Timothy, if you are out there listening... please take heed: I dig your novel as a whole, but don't ever scar your readers lives again by using the aforementioned adverb and metaphor.  That being said... Heir to the Empire was a very deliciously enjoyable escape from reality. I am now going to read the 2nd book in the trilogy (when it arrives) and I can't wait to begin.  Grand Admiral Thrawn was a great character and a worthy villain.  He was a viable threat which made him believable as a villain.  Jade Mara was a good as a tortured soul, however, I wish her reason for hating Luke would have been a little stronger.  Like maybe he killed her favorite pet bantha or something a little more sentimental and emotional. A woman just doesn't get scorned by losing her job when it was her own darn fault.  I know, 'cause I have scorned a few women in my day.  So, that premise was a little weak. On the inside back cover there is a picture of Timothy and he looks like kind of a nerd, which is fine.  But, I'm guessing he doesn't have much experience with women, in particular, scorning them.  So, I can certainly understand why he might mess-up that plot premise.  However, everything else was absolutely gorgeously great. Oh... and one more thing:  That HACK R.A. Salvatore isn't worthy to loose the latchet on your shoes.  Keep going Tim.  you've got a fan in me. You should write a new novel in which Usama Bin Laden is the leader of the Islamic Sith.  That would be a real corker.JugHead",4,"US"
1998-02-10,"The Force is with this one","Timothy Zahn has done the one thing I thought was impossible ... a Star Wars novel that is as exciting, intellegent and memorable as the movies themselves.  First class all the way, with Grand Admiral Thrawn the most manacing (statagists and inteletuals - and Thrawn is both - always make better villians than ""kill them all"" destructonuts,)and all the other characters are written with equal perfection.  If you enjoy exellent storytelling, look no further.",5,"US"
2003-04-14,"Clones Comic Clones Movie...almost","I realize that comic adapters have a lot of handicaps when doing comic books based on a movie that is not quite finished yet. And of course, the artists and writers do their best to catch the spirit, if not the letter, of a movie.

2007-01-26,"Not that good","I don't mean not very good, I mean not as good as people say it is. I really don't understand why people think Zahn is so brilliant.Zahn is an excellent storyteller, but honestly, he isn't a very good writer. The trilogy is plagued by gratuitous references back to events in the movies. ""Luke reaches for his lightsaber, and recalls when he was hung upside down in a wampa cave on Hoth and had to use the Force to get his lightsaber from the snow."" It's not necessary, and I groaned every time Zahn did it. James Luceno knows how to make appropriate and timely references. Zahn fails.I personally liked the specific technical jargon, but I'm surprised that most other people did, too.The story, though, what can I say? It's a good story. Grand Admiral Thrawn is the most awesome person I know. It was genuinely hard to be happy seeing the empire defeated this time around. I hated C'Boath, but then again, you'te supposed to.  The noghri are a fascinating creation and their story is followed all the way through.Everyone we know from the movies are there with a role, and act appropriately, although you never get the feeling that you've learned anything more about any existing character. New characters, like Mara Jade and Talon Kaarde, are superb additions to the saga. Creating characters really is Zahn's strongest point, I feel.The books fall victim of being written before the prequels, and being early EU novels in general but that is no one's fault, and the ""errors"" are reconciled easily enough.As a trilogy, it is consistent and drives towards a consistent goal throughout.One other thing about the story, and I think this is why so many people adore these books more than I think they deserve, is that it is epic. I have yet to read another Star Wars book or series that approaches the expanse and import of this trilogy. It really concerns a huge part of the Star Wars timeline, and as a story matches the significance of the movies themselves, unlike any other books. That doesn't make these books the best books, most interesting, or best written, but I think it is that epic feeling that makes this series so popular, despite being unspectacular in several ways.",4,"US"
2000-03-22,"The Saga Continues.....","Any Star Wars fan who has not read this novel is doing themselves harm.  This novel not only carrys on the adventure of Star Wars it makes you feel as if your watching the next movie.  Zahn does a superb job in portraying  the Star Wars galaxy and is without question the King of all Star Wars  authors.  New characters are introduced and the reader gets to see a  developing Jedi use the force to escape a ruthless and cunning warlord bent  on galaxy domination.  Han Solo returns along with his trusted sidekick  Chewbacca, and as one reads on they can almost see Han's trademark smirk as  he dodges death yet again. It is an excellent starting point, and pathway,  for any reader who desires to read more about the Star Wars universe but  doesn't know where to start. It answers many questions and reveals many  things thousands have been dying to know.  Get this book along with the  rest of the trilogy, and the force will be with you.",5,"US"

This proves useful when he goes to the cloning station on Wayland and the dark Jedi Juurus C'Baoth, but Juurus joins him immeadently on a deal that he will capture Leia & her unborn twins. So he sends out his speciel commando of Nogri to capture her. Then after a kidnap attempt Leia goes to Kashykk with Chewwie.

2000-02-10,"The best ""Heir"" that Lucas could want for Star Wars.","Heir To The Empire was a wonderfully written book with amazing plot development and some of the best characters in sci-fi since the original Star Wars.  The detail that this book gives makes you visualize every  action, and what is amazing is that it so easy to see every movement and  even the expressions of the intriguing characters.  If George Lucas ever  wrote Episode 7,8,& 9, I don't think that he could have done any better  than these stories.  Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, and The Last  Command are beautifully written books.  If you enjoy these, then you will  also want to read the other amazing books by Zahn.  Especially the Hand of  Thrawn two book set which sends you into the world of the characters of  this trillogy, but is set about a decade after the Heir to the Empire, Dark  Force Rising, and The Last Command trillogy ends.  Definitly good reading  for Star Wars fans and even those who are not.  Definitly don't miss these  books and Specter of the Past & Visions of the Future (Hand of Thrawn  set).  Believe me, this is some good reading, and it is packed with action,  politics, and cultural knowledge, even if the cultures are not real...  Zahn's details make it seem as though these people actually could be real,  and in some ways those details help to make the New Republic and the Empire  tangible.  I certainly recommend this book.",5,"US"
2014-01-30,"Review by Josh M.","I read Star Wars: Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn. I liked this book because since I saw Star Wars 6, I'v wanted to know what happens after the 2nd death star is destroyed. I also liked how the remnants of the Imperial Fleet are still commanded by a very high ranking imperial officer. I would recommend this book to any Star Wars fan. I would also recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what happened after Star Wars 6: Return of the Jedi. This book is the first in a trilogy. The other 2 books are just as good, if not better, than this one.",4,"US"
2005-07-07,"Best! of the Expanded Universe","There are a lot of Star Wars books out there now, but this was one of the first and still the best.Zahn knows the characters intimately and they are all believable--even the new ones. And his writing style will pull you in and keep you reading to the end.I tend to be a Star Wars purist--meaning I consider the movies to be the only real Star Wars authorities--but the Thrawn Trilogy and Zahn's other Star Wars duology are my exceptions. He does an excellent excellent job.",5,"US"
2006-07-02,"What Star Wars is all about!","Timothy Zahn is an exceptional author.  He masterfully captures Star Wars in a way that George Lucas should and is proud of.Heir to the Empire is an outstanding beginning to a three part cycle that will bring you to the edge of your seat.  Zahn demonstrates his writing qualities by having done plenty of research to show his knowledge of the Star Wars universe.  I can only imagine reading this when it first came out and there wasn't too much to read about the post Episode VI era.  This book will bring you into a world in which you will crave more Star Wars and more Timothy Zahn.The plot is awesome and I am really intrigued with the developments of Grand Admiral Thrawn.  Tons of action, great stories and hidden plots that refer to Jabba and other parts of Jedi and Empire (episodes VI and V!).  This adds tons of depth to Luke Skywalker and the up and coming Leia Organa Solo.Go Wedge!Highly recommend!",5,"US"
2006-11-01,"Highly recommended","Star Wars:  Heir to the empire is a book that follows the star wars plot line movie series.  A grand admiral, called Thrawn, has risen to the empire's throne followed by his captain Pelleon.  Thrawn finds a Jedi clone hidden on a nearly desolate planet and promises to give him Luke and a Leia who is pregnant with twins.Trying to escape the empire, Luke damages his X-wing badly.  Stranded, a smuggler (who took Jabba the Hut's place) named Karred and his newly appointed trainee, Marra Jade, find Skywalker and decide to hide him from the Empire.  Soon, Skywalker, Jade and R2 find themselves in the middle of the woods, hiding from the Empire, who awaits their appearance in a near by city.I recommend this book because it closely relates to the movies.  It stays with the plot and you find out more about the characters as you read along.  This book is the first in the series and progressively gets better as you read on.  If you loved the movies, then you'll love the book.  There's no telling what will happen next!Submitted by Lauryn's mom, age 13, MOD 2 Book review",5,"US"
1998-04-06,"Good stuff in the Star Wars tradition!","Timothy Zahn's ""Thrawn Trilogy"" is, in my opinion, the best Star Wars fiction available beyond the movies. Zahn is one of the best writers I have come across in some time. His style is excellent. The plots of the books in this trilogy are captivating and interesting, yet not difficult to follow or unreasonable in light of the original trilogy. His characterization of the familiar characters as well as some wonderful new ones is superb: Luke, Leia and Han develop just as we might expect them to be developing five years after ""Return of the Jedi""; the characters talk like we're used to hearing them talk (unlike in some of the other Star Wars novels, where they don't sound at all like themselves); and the new characters fit right into the Star Wars universe as if Lucas had intended to put them in the movies all along. Zahn's themes are interesting and well-developed, fitting well in the context of the themes developed in the movies. In all, I would definitely recommend this book to any Star Wars fan who is looking to expand his or her experience of Star Wars beyond the movies. It is a great trilogy.",5,"US"
2005-05-26,"Fun and Interesting Read Into The Star Wars EU","Many Star Wars readers will agree that Timothy Zahn is distinctively one of the best Star Wars EU writers. Heir to the Empire is part one of a three book trilogy (The Thrawn Trilogy)that was the first authorized SW novel to expand the SW continuity right after Return of The Jedi.  In this book, Mr. Zahn introduces us to new characters such as Grand Admiral Thrawn and Jorus C'baoth (not to be mistaken for Joruus C'baoth) and takes us back to ""the cave on Dagobah"" in one or two chapters.  The plot itself starts out relatively slow and doesn't start picking up the pace until the latter parts of the book.  Character development in the story was so-so.  Overall, I enjoyed the book as well as the other two novels in the trilogy.  I dont recommend reading it more than once.  There is also a graphic novel adaptation of the same name from Dark Horse Comics but I don't recommend it. Mr. Zahn mentioned a little hint about an Old Republic Jedi project called the Outbound Flight in the novel.  Look for Mr. Zahn's expansion of this event later in 2005 in a novel called The Outbound Flight.",4,"US"
1999-01-18,"A man deadlier than the emperor has appeared:Admiral Thrawn","Thrawn is an evil genuis who wishes to restore the empire in his image.His captain,Palleon is an equally ruthless man and a very good destroyer captain. Thrawn, who is one of the 11 Imperial grand admirals can predict  to the letter what his opponents will do. It is important to note that  Thrawn is an alien and to anyone who know of the Empire's anti-alien  policy, you must assume that he is outstanding in order to assume his  position as an Imperial Grand Admiral.  He does this by studying their  species artwork. His overall strategy is to destroy the rebel shipping and  capture rebel ships to use in the small Imperial navy. Another standard  imperial tool is terror. He seeks the help of a mad jedi master to help  communicate between ships and increase coordination during shielded  attacks. My favorite character in this book is Mara Jade, a rougish woman  similar to Han.  If you are to buy this book, I recommend that you buy the  other books in the triology because otherwise you will not be able to  survive the suspense.",5,"US"
1998-01-01,"""Heir to the Empire"" is a worthy heir to Star Wars!","""Heir to the Empire"" is my favorite Star Wars novel. If you loved the movies, you have to read this book. It's very well written.

THIS IS NOT A PIECE OF  LITERATURE, IT IS A FUN BOOK THAT CAPTURES THE FEELING OF THE MOVIES. Which  is what Zhan set out to do.  I you decide to skip this book I have pity on  you. The words STAR WARS on the cover at least warent reading the first  book.  And I found absoutly nothing wrong with this one.  In fact, I have  read the whole trilogy again after THE HAND OF THRAWN came out and enjoyed  it just as much if not more the second time.  By the way THE HAND OF THRAWN  books were also very good.I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD NOT LIKE THESE  BOOKS. As long as you read them for enjoyment. Afterall, ITS STAR WARS.",5,"US"

Since then I've again read it a  couple of times and everytime I am excited by the way Zahn continues the  movies. The characters and especially the ones he introduces are just  awesome. Grand Admiral Thrawn, who takes over the falling Empire, is the  best villain of all the books, Mara Jade is a great character to play  opposite Luke Skywalker.  The intriguing subplots that join smoothly  together to one great story are packed with all the good stuff that you  loved about the movies. and sometimes I really heard the soundtrack in my  ears.

All the original cast is in the book from our favorite wookie to r2d2.  Yet their is also new  favorites from a cunning admiral to the most mysterious woman in the  galaxy.  Zahn is a master at deveoping people, great plots and interesting  situations.  It is so good I had trouble putting it down more than one late  night.  His style has a never ending great description of new worlds and  cultures.  With in depth writing on their past and present standing.  It's  an incredible universe he throws out to us and it will take you on the next  thrillig chapter(literally) in the star wars adventures.

It shows the struggles of the Rebellion transforming into the New Republic and introduces a villain that you will enjoy so much you sometimes find yourself rooting for the bad guys.In my opinion the Zahn Trilogy are the best of the myriad of Star Wars novel out there.  If you love the original trilogy of movies, you will love these books.I had the chance to meet the man and have him sign the books for me.

2012-12-29,"Thrawn Trilogy","I just watched Star Wars this summer and was really into it and I heard great reviews about the Thrawn Trilogy. I just finished the trilogy today and I thought it was alright. I had a mixture of emotions through out the trilogy. Heir to the Empire started off slow but it then started picking up the pace and action as Jade is revealed and the issues over the Empire and the Imperials. I really had thought that after Vader and Darth Sidious died the galaxy was going to live in harmony and a couple of encounters here and there but instead it became chaos and Master C'boath was even thought to be more powerful than Darth Sidious. Dark Force Rising was by far my favorite out of the trilogy, the plot started unveiling and I was starting to become hooked. I really enjoyed the beginning of the Last Command but towards the end I didn't understand how Grand Admiral Thrawn foresaw the Xwing fighter's tactics. He usually studied there art and deciphered their strategies but some of the ways that he extracted the information to apply it to their strategies didnt make sense. The death of Thrawn was not as I expected, He knew the Noghri were up to something but he never came back to that and they ended up killing him. I expected this huge deception but it was nothing like I expected him to die. However, the ending wasn't too bad. It was alright but I expected more because I was actually starting to become hooked.",3,"US"
2004-05-13,"Great fun","A very entertaining, action-packed first volume in a trilogy that retains the values of the films.The Rebel Alliance has since become the New Republic and is struggling to form a galactic government with the planet Coruscant as its center.  However, the honeymoon period is about to be cut short, when a vicious tactical genius aided by a powerful Jedi Master take over the remants of the Empire and set out to destroy the fledgling New Republic.The characters that we know and love have grown in stature but have not lost their capacity to be in the center of things.  Luke's continuing his development as a fully-fledged Jedi Knight, Han has continued his shift to respectability by marrying Princess Leia and the two of them even have twins on the way who promise to be tremendously strong in the Force.  The famous droid duo of C3PO and R2-D2, and the Wookie Chewbacca all return as well.  Periphery characters such as Wedge and Lando Calrissian are fleshed out as well.New characters are also introduced.  The charming smuggler Talon Karrde makes an appearance, spearheading the remants of Jabba the Hutt's criminal organisation, and so does his fiesty red-haired partner-in-crime Mara Jade, a dangerous woman with a mysterious past and a sharp tongue.  A new race of gray-skinned aliens called the Noghri, who serve the Empire as lethal commandos, are also along for the ride.  The best of these characters though is the red-eyed, blue-skinned, white-uniformed Grand Admiral Thrawn; a deliciously brilliant tactical genius, dangerous and decisive, and with such a degree of class, charm and intelligence that its impossible not to warm to the guy.  He is also refreshingly grey in a universe that was depicted in the films as black and white (until that revelation at the end of the middle film).  He has a thirst for power, and does not suffer fools, but neither does he have the evil capriciousness that led Darth Vader to summarily execute those men who failed him.  He is a realistic military commander, who gets the best out of his available resources but does not waste them foolishly.The evil Jedi Master Joruus C'Baoth though is a relentlessly irritating concoction however, as petulant and moody as a teenager.  The fact that Zahn meant to have him this way does not soften the blow either.  I felt compelled to read on if only for the intensely satisfying moment when this guy would meet his doom.The writing itself is limited, but Zahn has an eye for an action set-piece and these don't fail to disappoint.  I did get annoyed at the overuse of the words 'sardonically', 'sarcastically' and 'countered', and the extensive tight smiles, lip twisting and sentence ellipsis.  Its still true to the films though, with space battles, fire fights and a healthy dose of stormtroopers, and the story itself is so full of twists and turns that it is a guaranteed page-turner.  Its no literary masterpiece, but if you love the films and a juicily convoluted plot that never fails to excite, then you won't go far wrong with this.",3,"US"
2004-07-18,"Spoiler alert. Some comments.","Hi.I would like to start out by saying that the book was very good but some things made me dissapointed (Maybe I had to high expectations to start with). I have a few comments I'd like to share. First of all it seems odd to me that Luke, as the big hero he is, only because he's out of Force he can't disarm Mara Jade when she holds him prisoner on the ysalamari planet. I mean, come on, he has the lightsaber in his hand, she points a blaster at him and he surrenders. Even without the force he should be a quite adept warrior shouldn't he?Why doesn't he do anything when she puts her blaster away on the ground?I get the overall sense of Luke as being quite naiv and going around the galaxy not really knowing whats he's doing.Then there's a time in the beginning of the book when Thrawn uses C'Baot to sense Luke presence and he talks to him a little. Then later in the book, Tnrawn and Pelleon is wondering if Luke is with the reps at a certain time and they wait to see. Why don't they just use the old Jedi to find out?There's a phrase in the book that goes something like: a Jedi can't be too caught up in events regarding galactic safety that he forgets about individuals. Isn't the motto supposed to be the other way around?Well, well. These small things made the book a little less entertaining than i'd hoped, but overall it's a good read.(Ps: Anyone know of a good place to discuss star wars litterature?)",4,"US"
2000-06-18,"Heir to the Empire -- a must-read Star Wars book","Heir to the Empire is one of the first books ever published about the Star Wars universe.  Its characters and events overlap into many other books, so I suggest you read this book first if you don't want to be confused.  Heir  to the Empire is the first in a trilogy by Timothy Zahn.  It takes place  five years after A New Hope, and has many of the characters from the  movies.  Although the New Republic is growing bigger every day, an Imperial  mastermind named Grand Admiral Thrawn has taken control of the Imperial  troops, and is concocting a plan to defeat the New Republic. Han and Leia  Solo,and Luke Skywalker must find out who is behind the many skillful  attacks on the Republic, and how to stop them.  There is also a dark Jedi  with the Imperials, who wants both Luke, Leia, and Leia and Han's unborn  twins to train.  There are many new characters, and Timothy Zahn is an  excellent author, with subplots and main plot woven together.  Even if you  don't read Star Wars, I suggest you read this book.  It is one of science  fiction's best.",5,"US"
2000-03-10,"Mara Jade is Awesome!","This was one awesome book! It was a great transition from the movies to beyond, and I loved the new characters. Zahn has created one awesome character in Mara Jade, and I can't wait to see more of her (see Vison of  The Future, also by the King of The Star Wars galaxy, Zahn himself). We  still got to see all the charactors from the movie, with the baddest guy of  them all. He's the person we love to hate, Grand Admiral Thrawn. Pellaeon  is an OK kinda guy, but I didn't like Joruus C'boath very much.I liked  Karrde, and liked how he was introduced as a bad guy, but later turns out  good. The ysalamiri were kinda confusing (come on, a Force-blocking  bubble?), and I loved being able to see more of Chewie's home planet. I  thought that part when Threepio imitated Princess Leia was kinda funny, but  I can't forget that wonderful moment when my favorite little droid came  back into action.

2002-05-23,"Save Yr Money","Your initial reaction to this book will be based on your feelings toward the film of the same name. The Star Wars saga tends to inspire fierce devotion and intense loathing.  It's one of those things.  Either your world is rocked or it isn't.  I tend to err on the side of the rock (although I'm not a freak or anything about it, I wouldn't join any queues in Seattle if you know what I'm saying).  I think Star Wars is alright.  Okay Phantom Menace was a little limp, but Attack of the Clones is a marked improvement (in a lot of ways it's better than, say, Return of the Jedi).This book, however, leaves me cold.When I heard there was a graphic novel of Attack of the Clones, I couldn't help but wonder just how it was produced.  Did all of the artists involved get a sneaky peek at the movie way in advance?  Are the artists involved the same artists that worked on the movie?  The back cover copy states that Attack of the Clones was ""adapted here in graphic novel format by writer Henry Gilroy FROM THE FILM'S ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY by George Lucas and Jonathan Hales.""  That's good, I thought.  That means that - okay, the artists are privvy to the action and the dialogue but, crucially, they can reimagine the context in which the action and the dialogue take place.  It's a graphic novel after all.  There have to sparks of invention otherwise - what is the point?  I mean, who would want to read a shot-for-shot version  of the film in graphic novel form?  Really?  I'd love to know.Because that is what you get.  Somebody has drawn the film.  This is a memento of that.  Which means, don't you know, that this is just one more example (and forgive me for being so naïve that it's taken me this long to say) of Lucas' need to spin as much money as possible from his fat Star Wars spider.  This is redundant art.  This is art as commerce, pure and simple.",1,"US"

Luke/Leia and Han getting out of every sticky situation they encounter and winning every battle. Grand Admiral Thrawn continue`s to lose every bit of the way. Kardde and everyone else seem to ""get over"" on this guy and it`s somewhat annoying that he can surmise exactly what`s going on in the minds of the enemy which doesn`t seem to amount to anything. Zahn to me is like Jack Higgens where you don`t question you just read and turn the pages. Mara Jade is constantly whinning about how Luke destroyed her life and while Leia is pregnant with twins she gets blasted around at many an encounter also. The Dark Jedi (C`Baoth)never mentions the name of the guy he defeated and the character is already rendered toothless and staid by the fact that he`s a clone (.....0r is that ""clown""?).",2,"US"

If George Lucas was going to make a movie to continue the Saga, these are the books he should base it on. The plot was riveting and the characters were spectacular, especially the Imperial warlord in this series, Grand Admiral Thrawn. A brillian tactician, he had the Rebels playing into his hands throughout the whole series, making me wonder how they would ever win against him. He was definitely worthy of filling the villain's role that the death of Darth Vader and the Emperor had left vacant. It was also a good book because it added a bit of Star Wars folklore and continued the story of Han, Leia, and Luke. I would recommend it to anyone, not just Star Wars fans.",5,"US"
1999-12-02,"Zahn...the Master","I am a fervant Star Wars fan, and have read every star wars book that has come out to date (up to R.A. Salvatore's new jedi order). I read heir to the empire and the entire trilogy it was in when it was realeased. And I  still must say, this trilogy is the BEST! the creation and twists in the  plot were brilliant. Character development, what can I saw, you basically  felt as though you knew the character's personally. And Zahn's technical  descriptions of everything never left you wondering whether things didn't  fitinto place.  There were no dead ends, and all levels of the book were  just fantastic.  I think this book and trilogy should go down as an all  time great (with the orginal movies of course) :).  Zahn your the man, and  I htink your follow-up duology, also rocked the house!",5,"US"

2014-12-06,"Fun Sci-Fi read for Star Wars lovers.","I've always enjoyed Star Wars and this was no exception. Everything about the story made me feel like I was watching a Lucas film in my head.

All the history was really interesting and gave me a new appreciation for the story and the Star Wars franchise.",5,"US"

1999-02-14,"A very unrealistic book","While the Zahn trilogy opened the way for all the star wars craze , I was shocked as to how highly people praised this book. My cheif complaint is one that has been noted , quite effectively , on this site. Zahn is a very  illogical person. The fact that he treats a whole planet as a small town is  ridicoulous. Han immediatly spotting one of Fey'lia's aids on the first  planet he visits is unrealistic to say the least. Another complaint is that  the best military commanders of all time always draw on facts , data , and  analyze a situation using that material , but Zahn , unfortunately has  Thrawn making wild guesses and states he is a genius , but a better term  would be lucky. this is understandable , since Zahn is only a writer , not  a general or strategist , but he should still be critisized. In my opinion  one of the worst Star Wars series of books. Dave Wolverton , and his more  realistic aproach in storytelling in The Courtship of Princess Liea , is  much more suited to that galaxy far , far away...",1,"US"
1999-08-11,"This book really tells us why we love Star Wars.","Zahn out did himself here.  I thought this was the best Star Wars book I've read.  I like the way the charactors have evolved since Return of the Jedi, and I love the new people.  My favorite is Mara Jade.  I thought her  hatred towards Luke was also a a great way of keeping them alive in the  woods.  Overall, this book rocks!",5,"US"
1998-04-02,"Zahn Continues the Star Wars Saga Better Than ANY Author","I've been absolutely thrilled with Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy.  He starts it off with this book, Heir to the Empire, continues the saga with Dark Force Rising, and brings it all to a spectacular conclusion in The Last Command!  Buy all three!  Then buy Specter of the Past - the latest in Zahn's Star Wars novels.END",5,"US"
1999-02-05,"ONE OF THE BEST EVER!!!","Having already read the hand of thrawn, this explained a lot of those two books to me.  This book contains the greatest warlord ever, GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN.  He's my favorite character from the books nest to Rogue 9, Corran  Horn.  This book is perfect for anyone, even if you didn't particularly  enjoy the movies.  This book and the rest of the SW books Zahn has written  will make you want to keep on reading.",5,"US"

The unofficial Episode 7 - 9 maybe? Although it differs from Lucas poetic rythm, it goes to prove Zahn can create Star Wars stories as well as its creator. The reason I only gave it four out of five is because Zahn needs a thesaurus badly. If he removed all  the times he says ""pursed lip, lip twitched, said conversationally, said thoughtfully, raised his blue black eyebrow, to realise he wasn't breathing...!"" the books would be half the length! And did Thrawn go to the Batman school of  conclusion making? Anywho minor gripes aside its very good. Yes this review was helpful... now buy and enjoy!!",4,"US"

2016-12-20,"You need to be a jedi like Yoda to finish reading this book..","Usually I do not do many book reviews, but this book urged me to do so. And I don't like to depreciate any work from authors. But the book is lame. The plot is poor as hell and it seems that the universe has a size of 10 cubic feet, due to the number of encounters that occur by pure chance in planets in horrendously far galaxies. Other point is about the characters. Luke looks like a high school jedi teenager who can't stand a minimal conversation with other characters or deal with enemies and reveal all the secrets to them.Just remembering, the timeline of the book is 5 years after the Rebelion's win! If Luke had entered Jabba's ship with the same attitude described in the book, he would be crushed by Salacious B. Crumb (that creature that keeps laughing on Jabbas shoulder). The villains, by the way, look like being much more jedi masters than Luke itself.At least I did not buy the other 2 books of the trilogy. Seriously, I tried VERY HARD to finish this one and it looked like badass jedi training.",1,"US"

Using men's souls to power up droid spaceships is pretty stupid, and turning around and saying that ysalamari is a dumb idea, you're just digging a bigger hole for yourself. Sure, I didn't think ysalamari was an EXTREMELY good idea, but it was necessary to the story, which is pretty good. If you ever read a Star Wars book, read this one. You won't regret it.",5,"US"

To those who disliked it, here's a suggestion,  instead of reading the book, increase your knowlege through the books which  the SW authors have written. Like how does Han understand mr Chewie's  language or that ysalamari(I think it's pronounced yesalamari) . It's cool  but thick.",5,"US"
2011-12-07,"Excellent!","This unabridged audio version is a HUGE improvement over the original. Marc Thompson does a superb job with the voices and the narration.As a side note, I think all Star Wars authors should be required to include a list of characters, vehicles, planets, etc. along with their phonetic pronunciations.

Unlike many other EU content, Zahn sets the bar for this trilogy not in a childrens book, but for a mature star wars fan {Geeks if you must}. Also very inivative for a star wars wrighter, uses things from past movies to form very intelectually synced idea. Fast paced, exciting, most definatly a page turner, and very well written. The only flaw i find with the book is Zahn's obvious fan based wrighting. That might not be a problem to others but to one such as myself it sometimes pollutes the story line with his so called ""flashes"" to movie seens that he seemed to have really enjoyed. Great book and a fantastic way to open up the trilogy.",4,"US"

2005-01-27,"Poorly written, not worthy of Star Wars name","I enjoy star wars immensely, and was excited to pick this book up. While it was a fun read, I am glad I got through it fairly quickly, because it was really thin on character development. Dialogue is rather childish and weak. The visual imagery is just not there; Zahn does not spend much time explaining anything to give it a real feel. He seems more concerned with the plot than explaining and getting into the subtle nuances of the references. In fact, no references are really followed up or explained; they are just mentioned and the story moves on, leaving the reader wondering 'what does THAT mean' or 'what is that creature', etc.I guess if I were in 8th grade and/or cared more about action than development, then it would have been more enjoyable. At this point, I haven't decided whether I will bother reading the second 'volume'. Or any other Star Wars novels, because I have heard many say Zahn is the best of the Star Wars novelists. If that's the case, reading any more novels would be a waste of time: I can find out the bare bones facts about anything star wars at the offical website databank.",2,"US"

2018-03-09,"Rather lame","I adored this book, and the entire Thrawn trilogy, as a teenager. About a year ago I was trying to explain these books to a friend when I realized I remembered nothing about the stories, so I decided to give them another go. I could not get through this one without constantly scoffing. The only reason I give this book 2 stars and not 1 is because Zahn introduced Thrawn, who is admittedly pretty lame in this book (Deus ex machina factory) but a cool villain in other Star Wars media. Zahn spends way too much time having characters consider pointless if-then scenarios, the majority of which never materialize as they are hypotheticals. I imagine Zahn does this to keep the readers guessing, but the effect is plain sleep-inducing. It's a type of sci-fi geek mental masturbation which is in the final sense deeply boring. The plot devices Zahn uses to march the story along are often so unbelievably out of touch with Star Wars that they turn it into a farce: consider the ysalamiri. Yellow space lizards (i.e., living things) whose bodies radiate an invisible bubble in which the Force (i.e., an energy field created by all living things) doesn't work? Come on, that's cheating. But it's double cheating when Zahn completely and flippantly gets out of explaining how the space lizards work by having Thrawn himself admit that even he does not know how they work but it doesn't matter because they do work so stop asking questions you dumb idiot. How convenient! Zahn is especially fond of the kind of writing that gets him out of having to really explain anything: he has no problem spending two pages describing in meticulous and mercilessly boring detail how a character went down a tunnel but resolves lowest-point kind of tension with such disappointing one-liners as ""And then he was there,"" or ""A moment later it was all over,"" which effectively absolve the author of explaining what really happened. Or another Zahn favorite, ""Character X did this thing [that the readers want to hear about], but Character Y didn't have time to enjoy it [so the readers get nothing].""  Zahn's writing thrives on this kind of non-explanation, and it works sometimes, but it is overburdened at all points by the boring, one-dimensional nature of the entire story and all its characters along with Zahn's many cheap tricks. Zahn's treatment of Leia Organa is downright sacrilege: she is insecure and submissive in a way that is totally at odds with her character. Zahn commits the most heinous sin against her less than 100 pages into the book when, after a tense scene the good guys nonetheless get out of okay, Zahn relates that Leia turns to R2 and says with a smile, ""now, let's get you cleaned up!"" as if she was the droid's (or someone else's) little servant girl. The writing is almost pornographic in its worship of these traditional male/female gender norms, and indicates the shallow, non-reflective depths Zahn has gone to in bringing us these one dimensional characters. The last person who tried to make Leia Organa their servant girl got strangled with a chain and then blown up. Come to think of it, that gives me an idea for what to do with this book...",2,"US"
1999-02-18,"Required reading for true Star Wars fans","Zahn is a master at how he weaves wonderful new experiences into the lives of the characters that we know and love.

2001-02-05,"Do, or do not. There is no try.","As Yoda once famously said in The Empire Strikes back: ""Do, or do not. There is no try."" And that is exactly what I would tell Timothy Zahn. He tried but he did not suceed. Heir to the Empire, I thought, was a very boring and thoughtless book. The ysalamiri were by far the stupidest things I have ever heard of, and C'boath was a pretty weak character. First, if these ysalamiri truly do have the power to repel the Force and temporarily strip Jedi of their powers, why have we not heard of them before? I think Thrawn is a good character, as is Mara Jade, but I find it awkward that Thrawn is so much more intelligent than the Emperor or Darth Vader ever was. He seems almost too smart to me. And even though I kind of pieced together why Mara Jade hates Luke so much before she revealed it, I thought it was a pretty half-hearted confession. I actually never quite understood why, in fact, she did hate him so much. I think this book had the right idea but it was poorly written. I realized I was forcing myself to read it, just trying to reach the end quickly instead of throroughly enjoying the book. There are much better Star Wars books out there. I suggest you read one of them, such as The Courtship of Princess Leia (read my review). Save yourself some time. You'll be glad you did.",1,"US"

2008-11-15,"Did Obi-Wan Teach you Nothing?!","I picked up this book when it was first released in 1991. Back then, Star Wars fans were starving for ANYTHING new and this book was the first thing to come out. I won't go into the plot of the story as other reviewers have done an awesome job in conveying it, and to be fair, it is an interesting plot. The delivery is something else altogether.The characters we know: Luke, Leia, Han, the droids behave true to their nature. A cool snippet comes early in the novel where Luke is sipping a cup of hot chocolate which he says comes from ""a planet called earth"". Silly perhaps, but a cool connection to us from that galaxy far away. The new ones: Admiral Thrawn, C'Boath, Mara Jade seem interesting but flat and one-dimensional. The problem is that Timothy Zahn is just not a good writer, at least not by this book.Why?Star Wars is as much a spiritual story (I'd argue more) as it is an action-driven story, but that aspect is forgotten, what we get instead is a constant stream of tech-babble that tests patience. Even as a kid, I always saw the Sci-Fi tech stuff as less important than the story, but in Heir to the Empire spends so much time going over technology that it almost becomes the whole story. Zahn constantly re-characterizes the SW universe to fit his tale and cheapens deep moments from the movies to piggy-back on them(grrrrr!).Examples? They abound...1) The strongest, darkest and most beautifully symbolic scene in all SW movies, to me, was Luke's going into the cave in Dagobah. It took me years to fully understand all the nuance of that moment or why Yoda had called it ""the failure at the cave"" even when Luke had seemed to prevail. Zahn dispatches that moment with some tech object being left behind by a dark lord. So Luke wasn't just fighting himself, being driven by hate, confronting his shadow or failing to integrate it (which is why Yoda called it a ""failure""), according to Zahn Luke was just attracted to some left-behind piece of technology?!2) The Force is understood to be another word for God or the basic energy of the Universe. It, Qui-Gon told us in the Phantom Menace, is the energy that moves everything from the midi-chlorians in our bodies to the galaxies in the universe. The Chi, the Prana, the Life Force. What I didn't know until Zhan told me in this book is that this all-pervasive energy is easily countered by a little furry animals called ""ysalamiri"", which are able to disable the force ""within a short radius"" (!!!), how ridiculous is this?! I was trying to give this book a chance until I read this nonsense. Apparently, the Force  flowing into the trees and forests where the ysalamari live in are not affected but all ""other"" Force is? This is just childish.3) Thrawn, the Grand Admiral, discovers that the old Empire fleet had only been effective because Palpatine had used the Dark Side through meditation to ""coordinate"" their attacks. Besides from taking a lot credit away from the Army of the Empire, Palpatine wasn't meditating when Luke and Darth Vader fought in Return of the Jedi, and his fleet was kicking the Rebel Fleet's butt until Han, Leia, the Rebels and Ewoks blew up the shield generator on Endor.Follow the logic here: Thrawn uses C'Baoth to ""meditate"" his fleet into fighting better, but is able to keep erratic C'Baoth under control because the ""ysalamiri"" keep his (C'Baoth's) Force subdued enough within the ""short radius"" around him but strong enough, mind you, to still help Thrawn's fleet through meditation... How people can read this nonsense and still give the book five stars is just incomprehensible to me.The final straw is chapter #17. At that point I realized there wasn't much hope for the rest of the book and no chance that I'd be reading anything else written by Zahn. You can skip it, the ENTIRE CHAPTER, and not miss a beat in the story! Where writers and editors scan entire books and and scripts for a line or two that does not add to the story, Timothy Zahn wrote a whole chapter that adds ZERO-ZIPPO to his novel.Back in 1991, Heir to the Empire filled a void Star Wars fans felt since the last Lucas-approved Star Wars ventures: the misguided ""Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure"" and ""Ewoks: Battle of Endor"" bombed at the box office. These days, when Star Wars fans are flooded with high quality games, books and TV shows, it is hard to remember there was a time when nothing SW-related came out. Yet, Heir to the Empire failed on almost every count; a book written by a Star Wars fan who didn't seem to understand what Star Wars is about.",2,"US"

But, I enjoyed it more than not, with only a few small complaints.ISSUE #1 - I hated the Wookie speak - I understand the need for it, but it was annoying, and I was happy when those chapters were over.ISSUE #2 - I dislike repetitiveness, and to say within three different chapter within 100 pages that someone 'waited a pair of heartbeats' - once sounds good - the second time jarred me and the third annoyed me.KUDOS#1 - I like that the book was a bookend, in that a story begins, and then splinters apart as the cast separates, only to culminate at the end together - it was done well, and seamlessly.I believe that even though this is no longer considered the official canon of Star Wars, this is a fun read, and worth the time.",4,"US"

2009-08-23,"Nothing Original Here","Once again I finish a book that has taken me months to read. This time it happens to be a Star Wars book. Before all the pre-quels and spin-offs there was only the original trilogy. No one had the authorization to create any stories within the universe that George Lucas created. That changed with the release of Heir To The Empire; the first book of a new trilogy in the time frame following Return of the Jedi. An author by the name Timothy Zahn received the ""go-ahead"" to create a trilogy in the spirit of the original stories.Volume 1 finds our heroes (Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, & Chewie) having formed a new Republic and dealing with the remnants of the Empire led by a military leader called Thrawn. Thrawn combines the scattered forces of the bad guys to take back the universe for the Empire. And, of course, he can't do that without the help of some guy who happens to be like a jedi only slightly evil...who wants Luke to become his apprentice. Does this sound familiar?There are new worlds and lots of space battles, but Heir To The Empire lost it's gold star when it became apparent that Zahn had nothing original to write. (Or maybe Lucas kept him from writing the trilogy he truly wanted to make...)",2,"US"
2000-08-13,"Simply the Best in Star Wars","If you like Star Wars, you CAN NOT live without this trilogy. That's all  there is to be said.

1999-12-13,"Nicely Done Book!","I have read many Star Wars books, and this is definitely one of the best. Zahn lives up to the book's name ""heir to the empire"", by creating a masterpiece.

2005-01-13,"Good story line, but not written very well","I enjoy star wars immensely, and was excited to pick this book up.  While it was a fun read, I am glad I got through it fairly quickly, because it was really thin on character development.  Dialogue is rather childish and weak.  The visual imagery is just not there; Zahn does not spend much time explaining anything to give it a real feel.  He seems more concerned with the plot than explaining and getting into the subtle nuances of the references.  In fact, no references are really followed up or explained; they are just mentioned and the story moves on, leaving the reader wondering 'what does THAT mean' or 'what is that creature', etc.I guess if I were in 8th grade and/or cared more about action than development, then it would have been more enjoyable.  At this point, I haven't decided whether I will bother reading the second 'volume'.  Or any other Star Wars novels, because I have heard many say Zahn is the best of the Star Wars novelists.  If that's the case, reading any more novels would be a waste of time: I can find out the bare bones facts about anything star wars at the offical website databank.",2,"US"

It doesn’t bother me that Carrie Fisher’s cadence is nowhere to be found but in order to sound feminine, Marc changes his pitch, puts in this weird lilt, a forced softness and calls it a day. Our bold, spunky princess sounds unsure of herself (and her sex) and it really pulls you out of the story.Definitely listen for the joy of a fun Star Wars tale in the spirit of the films, great character voices (many of which are original) as well as the sound effects, and music — but beware of the lady bits (intended) as you will find yourself forcibly ignoring Marc and imagining an actual woman reading for both Leia and Mara. And Mon Mothma, who sounds like she’s on quaaludes.Marc Thompson is insanely talented, and I’ll give him 5 stars for his reading of the book. It’s not his fault he doesn’t have a uterus.The story is also a solid 4 stars.

If you want a good sci-fi book,  read his Conqueror's series, not this or any other star wars book.  As for  why this book is not star wars... well in a word Thrawn.  Come on, a  brilliant general who can deduce a race's defense system by looking at one  of their paintings?  And he's got blue skin?

The invading ships spotted the attackers and shifted vectors—Pellaeon blinked. “What in the Empire are they doing?”“They’re trying the only defense they know of against a Marg Sabl,” Thrawn said, and there was no mistaking the satisfaction in his voice. “Or, to be more precise, the only defense they are psychologically capable of attempting.” He nodded toward the flashing sphere. “You see, Captain , there’s an Elom commanding that force . . . and Elomin simply cannot handle the unstructured attack profile of a properly executed Marg Sabl.”Pellaeon stared at the invaders, still shifting into their utterly useless defense stance . . . and slowly it dawned on him what Thrawn had just done. “That sentry ship attack a few minutes ago,” he said. “You were able to tell from that that those were Elomin ships?”""Learn about art, Captain,” Thrawn said, his voice almost dreamy. “When you understand a species’ art, you understand that species.”---If you can read that and not immediately vomit, you may enjoy the Star Wars EU.

Heir to the Empire does not deserve the title STAR WARS because it's characters are not original and the book itself is not very good. Heir to the Empire did not stand up to the reputation of the STAR WARS name.  I thought that the book was lacking action.  The whole book was somewhat still until the end started to pick up some action.  I also thought that some of the things were irrelevant to the traditional STAR WARS theme.  An example being the ysalamir, tree dwelling ""giant caterpillars"" that push back the Force.  This just does not make much sense for STAR WARS.  Another flaw I saw in the book was that the new characters did not fit in as well as older characters did.  The name Grand Admiral Thrawn does not strike fear into you as Darth Vader or the Emperor did.  Overall, I thought that Heir to the Empire was a letdown. There are people that agree with me, and people that disagree with me.  Tommy Jeffers disagrees and says ""Heir to the Empire is a guns balzing (sic), riproaring adventure that is worthy of the STAR WARS name.  Zahn's plot makes perfect sense and fits wonderfully into the STAR WARS universe.""  I tend to agree with C. Dault who says ""While it was a fun read, I am glad I got through it fairly quickly, because it was really thin on character development.  Dialogue is rather childish and weak.""  I believe he is right about saying it was ""really thin on character development."" This book does not deserve to be called a STAR WARS book because the author did a poor job of writing it.  Heir to the Empire lacked new, interesting characters and realistic creatures.  Overall, Heir to the Empire was not worthy of the name STAR WARS or even worth reading.",3,"US"

1999-01-02,"Finish what you start.","For those people who only read ""Heir to the Empire"" and decided they didn't like it, continue reading the rest of the trilogy. Only reading the first book of a trilogy is like only reading 1/3 of a story. One can't  base an opinion of a story only having read a fraction of it. Besides of  those people who reviewed the entire trilogy 93% gave five stars. Those are  good odds.I gave the trilogy four stars. Unfortunatly Mr.Zahn was  unable, or unwilling, to add new 'catch phrases', for lack of a better  term. Example, Han solo would only refer to threepio as ""Golden  rod"" The first time was O.k. but I got tired of it. I'm sure Solo  would have called him ""Threepio"" at least once.  I guess Mr.Zahn  thought it was very amussing but it got anoying.Basically If you like  star wars read it. It is a good trilogy, and very entertaining. The plot is  plausible, and The characters are great.Anyway if you want to  continue the Star Wars saga read the trilogy, The entire trilogy. Give  Mr.Zahn the courtisy to read his complete work.The End.",4,"US"
1997-10-02,"The perfect start for a perfect trilogy.","Timothy Zahn has proven that he can write like (George) Lucas by unleashing HEIR TO THE EMPIRE to the world. An ultimately excellent book, HEIR has captivated me by the opening scene, and by the time I finished, I was waiting for more. Letting loose Grand Admiral Thrawn, Talon Karrde, Mara Jade and all the others have been a really bright idea, and the emotional conflict between Luke and Mara has set me to read some more (even after finishing at least 10 chapters in a read). The idea of the Myrkr forest was fantastic, and Luke's irritating experience has set new heights here. The empire has really done its homework, having the best leader around, Thrawn, but the wimpy Pellaeon  looks as if he were just a hyper-accelerated trainee who was just in nursery school. There is ONE problem, though, and that is C'Baoth. This maniac is an insane rip-off of Darth Vader, and his dialogues are amateuristic. All in all, it makes the best book in Bantam Spectra history, and, with the flavor and fit of the films, this is a must-read for all fans and readers alike.",5,"US"

2002-10-22,"hmmm, well i didn't buy this book","I didn't buy this book but I've read it beforeIt's a cover of luke holding a light saber , wasn't sure whether it's a combo of all volumes from the trilogy, or just this volume...Well yeah it's about the heir of the emperor looking for the glove of darth vadar and yada yada...go buy the book if u want to know.i would say it's mediocre...no large scale battles or military conflicts, basically just stories between the characters...i still think that George Lucas' Starwars Trilogy are the best...Zahn's trilogy is too archetypical, nothing really special about it...it's fun to read since it's been authorized as the official continuation of the starwars trilogy by george lucas",3,"US"

I read it, and I immediately went  out and bought the other two books.  I couldn't wait to find out about what  would happen, and all of the other Star Wars books I have read just don't  compare.  Zahn is truely the master of the Star Wars Universe.",5,"US"

2012-03-27,"Well...","I read my original release paperback edition of this book for the first half of the reading. I switched to the CD for the second half. The CD quality and performance are fairly good. Yet, the quality of Zahn's writing is amazingly low. It's very bland, repetitive, and the phrases and terminology present often feel out of place for Star Wars material.The description and detail is *severely* lacking throughout. Which makes for a very fast but bland and detached reading experience. I did rather enjoy the voice work done for the three characters that I adore: Talon, Thrawn, and Gilad. These three 'grey characters' are likely to firmly become my favorite in all of the Expanded Universe.Though I gave this a read years ago when it was one of my last EU reads, I was completely underwhelmed. This time, fresh after a years long break and the background of Outbound Flight, I was still very bored through the majority of the story. The three characters I've mentioned above proving to be the only interesting elements present.Thrawn seems much more cool and detached in HotE than in Outbound Flight but is still very thoughtful and inclined to conversation, study, and efficiency. Just as he was when he served his own people, the Chiss. I am relieved to see that these hallmarks haven't changed. At least, not yet.Rediscovering Gilad, after such an extended absence, has been a joy. It felt like reuniting with an old friend. He is the Zahn character I know the best and I'm very fond of him.I've *never* cared for Mara Jade. I'm quickly growing to despise her anew. Frankly, I find it a bit of a relief that she's now dead. I rather feel it oddly appropriate somehow considering all the characters I have liked in EU the first time through save Talon (afaik) are dead as well. Though, this statement isn't meant to upset anyone. Peace, Luke/Mara fans.Despite Zahn's lackluster presentation via his writing style, I give the man credit for daring to create Imperials with standards that are *not* black as many wish to see them but instead various shades of grey, much like real people.",2,"US"
1999-05-30,"A really cool book","Its the first book written as a sequel to the movies.  Zahn is the only author who can write Star Wars well.  Even if you aren't a big fan of Star Wars, you'll still like this book.  The only thing I have to complain about  is the weird names of planets, and the lack of description of many things.",4,"US"
1998-09-21,"Wonderful","A great book for Star Wars fans. I couldn't put it down. Zhan, along with  Stackpole and Crispin, should be writing all the SW books.

The narrative of the book is pretty good. However the lack of description of the characters or the scenery makes this feel like a cookie cutter story. The side story of The Emperor secret assassin is so poorly contrived and utterly unbelievable. Throughout the Star Wars movies the Emperor was fine letting Vader go kill anyone. Then there is the stupid clones, with extra vowels in their names. The Lando and Kashyyyk tie ends didn't drive the story, nor did having all but Luke show up at Sleus Van. I hope that the upcoming Thrawn Book is better. I really don't think Zahn put a lot into this book. I've read his Cobra Series so I know he is a decent writer, but his Star Wars books lack anything original and were bland.",1,"US"

2008-02-06,"Doesn't deserve to be called a Star Wars story","The good: some characters are well developed and treated that they come alive such as Han Solo and Lando.The bad: The story seems to go nowhere, first chapters are really boring. I think Zahn fails to set the apropriated tension since the beginning.The Ugly: How did Zahn dared to write a Star Wars story that doesn't features a dramatic ending with a light saber duel???!!! (sorry if I spoiled but I had to say this) This is not a complete story, it leaves you in the middle of something (nowhere in particular), it doesn't work as a unit like ep V which despite it is to be continued, it has a clear climax.I'm very disapointed by this novel.",1,"US"
2012-03-11,"Disappointing and highly inconsistent with Star Wars canon","Having been a fan of Star Wars since seeing the original trilogy in theaters as a child, I only recently started reading the novels of the expanded universe and bought Heir to the Empire because it is widely regarded as one of the best starting places.After reading the first hundred pages I can't imagine how any real fan could think so. I'm so disappointed with the story I'm not even going to continue reading. There are numerous inconsistencies with the Star Wars canon, including a non-human in a leadership position in the Imperial Navy, a supposed Jedi using Force lightning which is typically considered a ""Dark Side"" technique, and the inexcusably contrived and idiotic plot device of the Ysalamiri - furry, force blocking reptiles - which despite the weak attempt at justification as an evolutionary response to force sensitive predators is inconsistent with the idea of the Force flowing through the entire universe, all living things, etc.The portion I read was boring and the inconsistencies with Star Wars canon and lapses in common sense were highly irritating. I wish I could unread the book and forget Thrawn, the Ysalamiri and the rest of the insults to my intelligence contained in the first hundred pages. This book was a huge disappointment after reading the highly entertaining Dark Lord Trilogy Star Wars: The Dark Lord Trilogy: Labyrinth of Evil  Revenge of the Sith Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars (Random House Paperback)) and has turned me off from reading any more of Zahn's work in the Star Wars universe.",1,"US"

2015-04-01,"A fantastic read!!!!","Heir to the Empire is book #1 of three. The three books are collectively known as the Thrawn Trilogy. Book one was published by Bantam Spectra in June 1991. The time line is 9 ABY.There is something about a book that pulls you into the plot and the characters like a movie. If you enjoy reading such material Timothy Zahn is the author for you! The interaction between the legendary characters that we have come to know and love, are clear and felt as if they were standing in front of you in a play.This epic book takes place five years after Return of the Jedi and finds Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian to name a few well into another heroic adventure. The integrity of the characters is heightened in this novel (one of three), and never lost.The character  Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn is the type of evil you enjoy hating like Emperor Palpatine. In fact, the position of Grand Admiral was created by Emperor Palpatine to increase his control over the imperial military. So, Thrawn’s ruthlessness has the stamp of approval from the Emperor. Thrawn is a great antagonist and plots a way to capture Luke and his sister Leia, who is married to Han Solo and carrying his twins. He wishes to hand them over to the Dark Jedi Joruus C’baoth.The Captain of the Star Destroyer Chimaera is Gilad Pellaeon. It is on the Chimaera Grand Admiral Thrawn resides.  Pellaeon feels a great unrest for Thrawn, who has a vast knowledge of alien worlds and a cold, empty personality. He uses the art he collects from different alien cultures to study their weaknesses. He has an heir of terror about him with his red gleaming eyes, blue skin and simmering anger beneath the surface. He also is accompanied by a ruthless Noghri named  Rukh he uses as his personal bodyguard.In this story, Mara Jade is introduced and has a mysterious past complete with a dark hatred for Luke. She is now working with the foremost smuggler Talon Karrde. He employed her because of her complex and well-honed skills he finds useful in various areas of his business. It is suspicioned she has a bit of the force in her. The speculation becomes more apparent after Luke meets her.So far, the New Republic has taken headquarters on Coruscant in the emperor’s Palace. Luke is being tormented by dark memories and other things like a voice from out of nowhere he believes to be another Jedi. All of these things are bothering him as well as feeling a dark presence in the palace he cannot put his finger on. Sometimes he feels it is a dark force imprint from Emperor Palpatine. Leia feels his emotions through Jedi senses and expresses great concern. It becomes apparent this is something he needs to work through on his own. He travels to Dagobah where Master Yoda lived and found something that leads him to Lando Calrissian.There are worlds we have heard about through the Star Wars universe many times. However, we get to see Chewbacca’s home world Kashyyyk when Leia is taken there. It was well described with vast imagery that made me feel like I could really see everything the author was showing. Every element used from the past or new elements incorporated by the author fit into the canon world of Star Wars perfectly. The smooth way the story unfolds and blends seamlessly into the Star Wars universe makes the reader want to read on.I felt like I stepped into the last film and took off where it left off. Wonderful story telling. In an effort, not to give the entire plot away, I shall stop here. I highly recommend Heir to the Empire the first book in the Thrawn trilogy. Bravo for a must read book series.",5,"US"
2008-01-12,"Star Wars Revisited","Heir to the Empire, the first in a series by Timothy Zahn, takes place about five years after the events portrayed in the movie Return of the Jedi. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia are all together again. Han and Leia are married expecting twins, and Luke has begun training Leia as a Jedi while secretly harboring misgivings and constantly questioning if his actions are appropriate for a Jedi. The New Republic is on shaky political ground. Admiral Ackbar's position of leadership is threatened. Leia, to her own risk, is pressured into continuing to act as an ambassador for the New Republic, while Han Solo tries to persuade smugglers to turn legitimate and work for the New Republic. Unfortunately, the Empire is not dead. A New Grand Admiral has emerged on the scene intent on the capture of Luke Skywalker, and he isn't the only one.Initially, I had trouble getting into this novel, but I found my interest accelerated after watching the movies of original three episodes again. The characters I love, Han, Luke, and Leia, are back together again, and Han Solo is just as sarcastically funny as he ever was. I recommend this book to Star Wars fans looking to both revisit the old magic of Star Wars and experience it anew. May the Force be with you.",4,"US"
2014-10-09,"The Starting Point of the Expanded Universe...or Legends...you know....","This is THE classic Expanded Universe novel. Now that the EU isn't canon, the discrepancies between this book and the Clones described in the prequel. Even with that said this book raises a lot of interesting questions that may become major themes in the new movies.I love C'Baoth, he reminds me of a time when Star Wars was more mystical and less about mundane political and military action. The book features a Luke Skywalker at a crossroads in his life. Years before the Jedi Academy came to fruition Luke had no sense of guidance and had no idea how to train someone else in the Force. What if he is misled? What if someone with a warped view of the Force makes convincing arguments? And the whole time theres a pregnant Princess Leia trying to help lead a New Republic while being stalked by an unknown evil species... Awesome book, I have 4 or 5 copies of it.",5,"US"

Timothy Zahn did a masterful job of completing the series.  It is unfortunate that these were never filmed as Episodes 7-9 since they are the authentic story.

It is very annoying to be reading a comic and you know what the characters look like, but you can't recognize them because of some creative license the artist took.  I starting buying star wars comics because I could sit and read them with my small children.  With one exception, star wars comics are always family friendly books.
