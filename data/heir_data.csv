"Kevin Tracy","US","August 5, 2018","Dated by the prequels, but still better than Disney's films","I re-read this trilogy after becoming disillusioned with the Disney sequel trilogy.  I enjoyed this MUCH more.  I know there was a lot of ""Expanded Universe"" (now Legends) crap being published, but the Thrawn Trilogy was not among it.You could tell it was written prior to the release of the Prequel trilogy because of terms like ""Dark Jedi"" instead of ""Sith"" and other things that don't quite fit with those films.  However, it's very easy to read past those inconsistencies and enjoy this trilogy.  I really wish Disney had re-worked these books into their trilogy so that events herein take place 30 years after Return of the Jedi rather than the 5 years in this book.  It would have been MUCH more enjoyable.",5
"Patrick","US","August 25, 2017","Best Star Wars author best series in the fanverse","Timothy Zahn Star Wars books are the best and Thrawn is a great villain. The detail about the force abilities and thinking that goes behind Luke's choices is done very well. I never thought I'd like a Star Wars fan fiction book until I read this series. If you are a fan I highly recommend it as will anyone else who has ever read any Star Wars books. It's obviously good enough that Disney even added Thrawn to the official Star Wars universe as he is in the show 'Star Wars: Rebels.' I'm sure many would agree all the Thrawn books, would have made for great movies, but still they are great on their own no matter what the movies do with the characters",5
"ST","US","September 26, 2016","The story flows seamlessly from one scene to the next as the action progresses culminating - much like Return of the Jedi - with","The final installment of the Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy has everything anyone reading the first two novels in this series could have wanted.  The story picks up approximately a month after the events of Dark Force Rising as the Empire begins to press the advantage they won at the end of the last novel.  Once again, Zahn's writing shines as he uses such vivid detail that it is almost impossible not to visualize the story as if you were watching it on a screen.  The story flows seamlessly from one scene to the next as the action progresses culminating - much like Return of the Jedi - with a space battle, a ground battle and a force battle at once, ensuring a gripping finale to an outstanding series.",5
"jesse_mathewson_reviews","US","July 20, 2017","A trilogy from a true master of words!","Timothy Zahn is a mastermind of science fiction.  As an author his brilliance is on par with Poul Anderson and the like. This series is an amazing continuation of the Star Wars universe. Especially considering he does so much to build characters, create new worlds and all while staying in line with the amazing alternate universe that is the Star Wars universe.A must read, it will fill in gaps and create new and better possibilities.",5
"Jeffrey Sandoz","US","December 16, 2017","Star Wars: The Last Novel","This is it; the last Star Wars novel worth reading.  Even though this novel is long, drawn out, and sometimes hard to follow - this book is still so much better than all the new “canon” books, and the other “Legends” books.  In this Thrawn series, the author took risks, had original new ideas, and actually did something with the characters.  You will never see another Star Wars novel like these Thrawn books.  All the new novels do is just play it safe; never advancing any serious Star Wars stories.  Bravo, Timothy Zahn!",4
"Dave","US","October 1, 2012","A Thrilling Conclusion!","The Last Command is the third book of the Trawn trilogy, which takes place a few years after ""Return of the Jedi"". In this final installment of the series, full-scale war has reignited in multiple sectors acoss the galaxy, and the Empire is regaining control of planets necessary for reestablishing system dominance. The brilliant part about this final book is we get to see Grand Admiral Thrawn demonstrate his full tactical genius in combat as the Empires chief of command. Not only has be managed to make massive restorations to the empires fleet through expert covert operations resolved at the end of  the second book, ""Dark Force Rising"", he is also able to utilize his gains with surgical precision and efficiency. My favorite part is that Thrawn establishes himself as a villain that you come to respect and believe in! Not only is he clever and effective he is also respectful to his crew and subordinates. One may argue that this is because the insane Jedi Master C'baoth is seeking to gain supremacy over the Empire and establish himself as the new emperor. Thrawn is placed in a difficult position of having to guarantee the loyalty of his soldiers by maintaining troop morale, and establishing mutual respect while C'boath uses his dark powers of manipulation in an attempt to subvert Thrawn's hard-earned authority. This is, by far the most complex and compelling villain dynamic I have yet seen in a star wars storyline!The situation with the rebels is also brilliantly executed. Mara Jade must carefully navigate her shifting allegiances as she struggles with her own challenges both internally and with her continually shifting circumstances. She must find a way to resolve the awful spell that palatine beset upon her, compelling her to kill Luke Skywalker in vengeance. She also doesn't exactly like Luke, because the death of the emperor terminated her previous position as hand to the empire, which was considerably lucrative. All of this occurred years ago, and Mara is beginning to process this anguish, which only makes the conflict within her even more difficult. It's far easier for Mara simply to hate Luke, but she finds herself needing his help in this third book, and her situation becomes only more complicated, when the alliance learns of her history with the Empire!Sadly, Winter plays a minimal role in this book. I always found her to be one of the more fascinating characters with her photographic memory. She spends most of her time caring for Leia's child in this book. Leia makes a big power play, going off on a limb to lend aid to the Noghri, a race of short lizard-like aliens that have been loyal to the Empire, but only because of their respect for Lord Vader. Leia uses her investigative and diplomatic skills to utilize this inherited esteem, which ultimately results in significant effects.Many other exciting challenges take place for Luke Skywalker in this book. Master C'boath, Thrawn and a few other surprises along the way keep him more off his feet than usual! There is so much else that happens, that is masterfully resolved in this book it would take too long to describe. The smuggler Talon Karrde attempts to rally the rest of his smuggler associates against the empire, which proves to be a very difficult task. Every storyline in this book is entertaining, and finds a way to wrap itself into the significance of the overall conclusion.  I only had one problem with this book, and it has to do with a rather silly quote in one of the final chapters having to do with Thrawn's fascination with art. You'll know it when you get to it. For that to be one of the only things that really bothered me about the book though is amazing, because I'm usually really picky. This book is defiantly a good pay-off if you weren't as impressed with the first two. Timothy Zahn makes this one count, and puts in a lot of great moments as well as excellent conclusions.",5
"R Strickle","US","June 16, 2017","Excellent","This series is great. The author did a masterful job of telling what happens after the Emperor falls and how the last of his Empire fight for what they feel is right and how the New Republic forms amongst all that drama. I recommend all Star Wars fans to read this series.",5
"Raymond Hicks","US","September 24, 2014","BEST STAR WARS BOOK EVER!!!!!!","the reason I'm giving this book the 5 star is simply out of appreciation for the author's fantastic work. Like all the books of the Thrawn Trilogy, it was fast-paced, witty, action-packed, and compelling. Everything in the Star Wars we know and love. This one however eclipsed the past two completely. The conclusion involved the internal struggle of Mara Jade as she wrestles with the decision of fulfilling her dead master's last command and Luke prepares for his final battle with the psychotic dark jedi Joruus C'baoth. The battle against the empire seemed hopeless as we keep seeing the new republic pounded by Thrawn's clone troopers and dark force fleet to the point where the reader thinks: Are they going to do it? Will the New Republic prevail? What's going to happen?! Zahn does a good job of building up all this hatred toward C'aboth and yet understanding why he is what he is. I liked seeing what was happening in both fleets and every move they pulled. Nice that the military theme in Star Wars was expressed. Something that was glossed over in other books. Last thing, my most favorite part of the book was the events speeding up to the end and the most epic conclusion in science fiction; including the last battle against C'baoth which brings out a big surprise. I won't give spoilers but I'll give you a hint: A duel of the soul in a dark cave. Thank you Timothy Zahn for writing such a great book worthy of Star Wars! Thank you and may the force be with you!!!",5
"(¬<U+203F>¬)","US","October 23, 2011","Review of the Kindle version","For days, I have been trapped in the Star Wars universe reading Timothy Zahn's trilogy.  My poor husband had to suffer from me reading The Last Command (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 3) through the night.  All I can say is WOW.Zahn once again recreates the Star Wars universe in all its glory.  All the main characters remain true to themselves and maturing as we would expect.  Leia and Han are parents, Luke is all grown up.  Lando is becoming much more likeable (I never did like him in the movies).I can honestly say I'm not crazy about the ysalamari or C'baoth, although I guess it's better to make the Master insane than be someone we have to take seriously.Thrawn redeemed himself to me.  I can finally accept him as Grand Admiral, ironically because of what happens to him at the end.  Up until that point, I felt his portrayal was a little unreal.  II'm in love with the interplay between Mara and Luke.  It was brilliantly crafted.  This is why the Star Wars movies were so successful -- the interaction between the characters.  Zahn brings it all back.  Hints and allusions weaving in and out of the story.  I knew it from the beginning.  Mara Jade is undeniably the best addition to the Star Wars universe.  I absolutely adore her.  Pair her with Luke and it's magic.I'm so glad Zahn was picked to do this trilogy.  He brought back the characters we all know and love in a way very few authors ever could.  This last book ties up some loose ends; but it thankfully leaves a lot more to explore, which is why I'm off to read the ""Hand of Thrawn"" duology.(If you're thinking about the Kindle version, it is mostly well formatted with a few spelling/grammatical errors and some spacing problems.  For the most part, those things did not detract much from my reading experience.)",5
"Yagyu","US","August 14, 2013","Yagyu review","This was an amazing book. A wonderful end to an amazing trilogy.Pros:1: It was so Artfully done. This is actually a quote from Thrawn at the end but once you read it and see why he said it, im sure you will agree.2: C'baoth. Joruus C'baoth reaches his peak insanity and lets the darkside fully consume him making for a great villain and successor to Palpatine.3: Mara Jade. She really shines here in this book and overcomes allot of the brain washing that Palpatine did to her.4: Luke and Luuke. Luke feels about right in this, hes still trying to save rather then kill which makes sense and follows his character well in return of the Jedi.5: Noghri. They really get awesome in this book and we see them get some justice.Cons:1: Luke and Luuke? Theres a clone and the spelling of the name well yeah, just like the C'baoth clone its spelling is a little annoying. I love Zahns writing but i think saying so and so's clone would have been better then just doubling a letter in the name.2: No grand lightsaber duel. Well technically this isnt true, Mara and Luke do get to use their sabers. But I really wanted to see C'baoth's skill with a Lightsaber.Nothing really else bad to say about the book. Its an awesome read. So go check it out!!!",5
"Ken","US","December 17, 2017","Legends should be canon","After seeing the latest movie, I am sad to say that Disney is killing the Star Wars of my youth.  These stories, ""Legends"" as they are now called, are so much better and it is sad that they are not canon. They understand what it means to be Star Wars and captures it nearly perfectly.",5
"Cutun","US","January 17, 2018","Exciting","This is a really good Star Wars novel, the culmination of the series is fast paced and exciting. It is nicely written and enjoyable. The only reason why I don’t give it 5 stars is because it seems to use too many of the story elements from other Star Wars stories for my liking, mainly Return of the Jedi, so a little deduction for that.",4
"Danial Hallock","US","September 11, 2013","The Climatic Finish","In this final episode of the Thrawn Trilogy, we watch as the questionable choices that Leia, Han, and Lando made come to fruition. During the previous two books, we watched this trio make choices that seemed very risky and its in this book that we watch the pieces of the puzzle fall into place.  The brilliant Grand Admiral Thrawn seems to out smart the Republic at every turn, and it's only through the culmination of fringe efforts that defy logic, and the growing strife between the Admiral and Jedi Master Cboath that the Empire can be stopped.",5
"Brian Lynch","US","December 6, 2014","Great series, really captures that classic Star Wars magic","This series is awesome. If you are on the fence go for it. Fans of the original trilogy will dig it for sure and this last book might be the best one. Great ending in my opinion. This really has that Star Wars ""magic"" and feel to it. Great writing and characters. I was weird about reading them because  Episode 7 is coming out soon and it will not follow this as the Expanded Universe is not canon but I don't regret it one bit. I believe that DIsney and Abrams are doing a great job with the new Star Wars from what I have read and seen and I am confident that I will be able to enjoy that story in conjunction with this one even though they are not about the same characters. Check it out!",5
"Joe","US","January 5, 2014","Great final book to the 'Thrawn' trilogy","Third and lat book of the 'Thrawn' trilogy, the entire set tells weaves a mighty fine story throughout the three books. Zahn has done a superb job on this story. It's adventuresome, fun, filled with well fleshed-out charcters, and vey intelligent. Never dull and nicely paced I found it hard to put down. Didn't want the books to come to an end.Space battles, new and powerful enemies, intrigue in the New Republic government and old grudges to be settled. All the gang is here and they're very entertaining!These three books are the best of all the supplemental SW books, in my opinion of course.",5
"Sue Walker","US","February 20, 2018","Timothy Zahn's books are one of the reasons why I really love to read Star Wars books","Book was extremely worn (more than I thought it would be), but readable.

Wish i learned of Timothy Zahn long long ago...","I've been reading star war's novels my entire life and had never truly been satisfied... Until now!!! Timothy Zahn is now my favorite author especially in Star War's saga. Truly engrossing and characters area well done. Spent most of my vacation reading this trilogy on the beach (FYI, not a Beach fan but best time I've had in ages.) Well worth every word read. Constantly found myself saying just ones more chapter.",5
"Jason Kent","US","May 4, 2015","As the finale of an amazing Star Wars trilogy","As the finale of an amazing Star Wars trilogy, I would highly recommend this book (and it's two predecessors) to any Star Wars fan.  I read these when they first came out years ago, and still enjoyed them 20 years later.  With episode 7 coming out this winter (2015), these make for a fun 'what if' scenario of what might have happened to those characters I grew up with.",4
"D. Skidmore","US","November 29, 2017","I greatly enjoyed reading this book","I greatly enjoyed reading this book. I was very disappointed to find that I had finished the book at 77%. The remaining 23% is just ""about the author"" and excerpts from other books.",3
"SABell","US","July 16, 2000","Audio Rendition is Excellent","Timothy Zahn tops himself with a slap bang ending to this Star Wars saga.  There is not much I can add to other reviews.  However, the audio book is abridged and some of the story seems to skip forward at high speed.  Once  again Anthony Daniels (C3PO) does a great job reading.  His voice  characterizations are the same as in ""Dark Force Rising"" allowing  the listener to keep the many characters straight and concentrate on the  plot(s).  The audio and special effects are crisp and clear and easily  understood in a car environment.  The best of the three books and well  worth the purchase price.  Run time:  180 minutes.",5
"NWLB","US","March 31, 2013","Excellent and leaves you wishing for more.","Strongly recommended.  Zahn's writing captures the feel of the movies and Star Wars universe. This was the Star Was expanded universe before Lucas let it run amuck with ever growing numbers of basically lousy writing and poorly thought-out continuations.  You feel these stories fit well and would have made excellent movies.  You don't have over-the-top characters like the Vong or million ship mega battles that simply feel like cop-out rather than well considered Star Wars scenarios.",5
"Billy Jordan","US","April 14, 2013","Great series on the go!","I really have been wanting to read this series. I unfortunately can no longer find the HC trilogy for a reasonable price. I noticed I could get this on Kindle and thought, why not? I am usually not a very big into digital purchases for some things but I am quite happy with this purchase and can't wait to read these books! If you are a Star Wars fan, these books are considered by some as a true continuation of the Star Wars saga! This can get you buy till Episode VII comes out!",5
"M. Weeks","US","January 21, 2016","Timothy Zahn is the greatest Star Wars writer out there","Timothy Zahn is the greatest Star Wars writer out there. Grand Admiral Thrawn is my favorite bad guy of all time, and I loved reaching the end of this trilogy. It was fun from beginning to end, with twists and turns and terrific characters.

"J.D.","US","June 5, 2016","Well worth a read.","A fitting finish to a superb series. Zahn is an excellent writer, and proves it here. There are no loose ends, and he manages to keep you so focused on the penultimate showdown, that you are unaware of each closing minor plotline.",5

Most people that you encounter would claim to be some type of Star Wars fan. I was always enthralled by George Lucas's groundbreaking films, but it wasn't until I read Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy that I became a genuine Star War's fanatic. Zahn captures the audience in the first book of his three part series and doesn't not fail to keep the reader entranced throughout the conclusion of The Last Command.  Zahn's mastery of the art of suspense will keep any reader engaged and captivated, whether he or she is a novice Star War's fan, as I was, or a seasoned Star War's fanatic. After reading The Last command, I could not get enough of the world of Star Wars. Timothy Zahn's The Last Command is a must read for anyone who claims to love Star Wars.I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did and I hope that you will be encouraged by Zahn to further explore the intricate galaxy of Star Wars.",5

I mean you always gotta have a (dark sider) in there some place but an evil genius admiral works too. All the old gangs here from 4 5 6.
